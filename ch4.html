                     contained in the digital bibliography and the text corpus are analyzed on a
                     metadata level in this chapter. One goal of this analysis is to provide a general
                     overview of the contents in both databases: how many novels are there in the
                     reference bibliography (of which subgenre, written by which authors, published in
                     which of the three countries and when)? How many novels are there in the corpus,
                     and is the corpus similarly structured in quantitative terms, or are there
                     differences between both resources? Furthermore, the quantities of novels by
                     subgenre in the corpus are assessed to find out which groups are big enough to
                     carry out a quantitative text analysis. A choice is then made for two discursive
                     levels (thematic subgenres and literary currents) and a specific set of subgenre
                     labels (the primary labels on these two levels) to analyze the novels further in
                     the text analysis part. When the numbers of novels in the bibliography and corpus
                     are compared, and differences are observed, these are mainly described in
                     qualitative terms, which means that the numbers are interpreted and set in
                     relation to each other. However, statistical tests for significance are only done
                     in the case of the novels’ text length. On the level of the metadata categories,
                     most of the groups are quite small, so most differences are not expected to be
                     significant in a statistical sense. Nonetheless, they show how specific subsets of
                     the bibliography and corpus proportionally vary.</p>

                        question is to what extent the results can be interpreted as statements about
                        the subgenres in question and not only about the selected novels in the corpus,
                        that is, how far they are generalizable. The search for an answer to this
                        question involves determining the representativeness of the corpus. Assuming
                        that the corpus does not consist of the entire literary production, to which
                        degree does it represent it? How to capture “the entire literary
                        production”?</p>

                        design have been addressed by Douglas Biber, in particular (<span class="w3-tooltip w3-border-bottom w3-border-blue-grey">Biber 1993a<span class="w3-text w3-tag w3-round w3-blue-grey w3-left-align w3-padding w3-large" style="position:absolute;left:0;bottom:25px">Biber, Douglas. 1993a. “Representativeness in Corpus

As he formulates,
                        “[r]epresentativeness refers to the extent to which a sample includes the full
                        range of variability in a population” (<span class="w3-tooltip w3-border-bottom w3-border-blue-grey">Biber 1993a, 243<span class="w3-text w3-tag w3-round w3-blue-grey w3-left-align w3-padding w3-large" style="position:absolute;left:0;bottom:25px">Biber, Douglas. 1993a. “Representativeness in Corpus

Two important terms are
                        introduced here: the <em>population</em> as a whole, such as the entire
                        production of a spoken or written language or the entire literary production,
                        and the <em>sample</em> as a selected section of the population. Biber
                        states that the assessment of the representativeness of a sample depends first
                        on a prior definition of the population and second on the sampling technique
                        used to make selections from it. He mentions two important aspects for the
                        definition of the population: “(1) the boundaries of the population—what texts
                        are included and excluded from the population; (2) hierarchical organization
                        within the population—what text categories are included in the population, and
                        what are their definitions” (<span class="w3-tooltip w3-border-bottom w3-border-blue-grey">Biber

                        making use specifically of the first aspect. The “Boundaries of the Novel”
                        (<a href="ch3.html#ch3.1.1">3.1.1</a>) specified what kind of
                        texts are included (novels) and how this generic kind is defined and delimited
                        in the current context. Furthermore, the population was situated
                        cultural-geographically and chronologically by discussing the “Borders of
                        Argentina, Cuba, and Mexico” (<a href="ch3.html#ch3.1.2">3.1.2</a>) and the “Limits of the Nineteenth Century” (<a href="ch3.html#ch3.1.3">3.1.3</a>). On the other hand, regarding
                        the second aspect, no restrictions were made for the internal organization of
                        the population in terms of types of subgenres. No specific subgenres were set
                        or excluded. However, the population is internally organized into works from
                        the three countries.</p>

                        operational definition of the population is needed, which is called “sampling
                        frame” by Biber: “an itemized listing of population members from which a
                        representative sample can be chosen” (<span class="w3-tooltip w3-border-bottom w3-border-blue-grey">Biber 1993a, 244<span class="w3-text w3-tag w3-round w3-blue-grey w3-left-align w3-padding w3-large" style="position:absolute;left:0;bottom:25px">Biber, Douglas. 1993a. “Representativeness in Corpus

The <em>sampling
                           frame</em> for the corpus Conha19 is the bibliography Bib-ACMé (see <a href="ch3.html#ch3.2">chapter 3.2</a>), to which the
                        population’s selection criteria were applied and the sources of which were
                        presented in <a href="ch3.html#ch3.2.1">chapter 3.2.1</a>.</p>

                        sampling relies on random selection and can, for example, be realized as a
                        simple random sampling, where all items have the same chance to be selected.
                        Another variant of probabilistic sampling is stratified sampling, which makes
                        use of subgroups in the population and applies random sampling to each subgroup
                        in a second step (<span class="w3-tooltip w3-border-bottom w3-border-blue-grey">Biber 1993a,
                           244<span class="w3-text w3-tag w3-round w3-blue-grey w3-left-align w3-padding w3-large" style="position:absolute;left:0;bottom:25px">Biber, Douglas. 1993a. “Representativeness in Corpus

For the creation of the corpus Conha19, no formal random
                        sampling was applied, neither general nor stratified, because the selection of
                        texts from the bibliography was restricted to the texts actually available in
                        digital format or a format suitable for digitization. So in this case the
                        availability of the sources had a strong influence on the resulting sample.
                        Nevertheless, in an informal procedure, the texts were selected in a way to
                        ensure a balance of countries, authors, and major subgenres as far as
                        possible.</p>
                     
                     <p id="p460"><span class="paracount w3-blue-grey w3-margin-right"><a href="#p460">460</a></span>One way to evaluate representativeness is by looking at the
                        sample size. Which overall proportion of the population is contained in the
                        sample? However, the aspect of how much of the population’s variability is
                        included is considered even more important by Biber. In the context of
                        linguistic corpora, he finds that 
                        <blockquote>
                           variability can be considered from situational and from linguistic
                           perspectives, and both of these are important in determining
                           representativeness. Thus a corpus design can be evaluated for the extent
                           to which it includes: (1) the range of text types in a language, and (2)
                           the range of linguistic distributions in a language.

                        linguistic: text types are bound to communicative situations, and the relevant
                        text-internal features are linguistic distributions. For a literary corpus,
                        corresponding requirements could be formulated in the following way:

                           <li>the set of authors in a given literature (because the authorship of
                              texts plays a much more important role in literary corpora and influences
                              the style of the texts considerably)</li>
                           
                           <li>periods in a given literature (because there are eras for which a

                           </ol> Of course, linguistic periods have similar relevance for the
                        construction of linguistic corpora. It can be assumed that Biber set a focus on
                        text types for questions of variability inside a corpus because the linguistic
                        period is only at issue in historical and especially diachronic corpora. </p>

                        the second criterion to determine the internal variability of a literary corpus
                        is not straightforward. More research is available on the range of linguistic
                        distributions in languages than on textual distributions in literature.<sup id="ftn367" class="w3-btn w3-theme-l3 w3-circle" onclick="document.getElementById('ftn367-modal').style.display='block'">367</sup>

                        novel”, it would be necessary to have general knowledge about textual
                        distributions in novels. To give examples, this could be knowledge about the
                        typical range in the amount of direct speech in novels or knowledge about the
                        typical distribution of topics in novels.<sup id="ftn368" class="w3-btn w3-theme-l3 w3-circle" onclick="document.getElementById('ftn368-modal').style.display='block'">368</sup> As things
                        now stand, though, knowledge about such textual distributions in literary texts
                        is rather still the aim of digital literary studies than a fund of basic
                        knowledge to which one could refer. Therefore, the second point is not used
                        here to evaluate the representativeness of the corpus. Instead, the sampling
                        frame Bib-ACMé and the sample Conha19 are compared on several levels that are
                        derived from the metadata encoded for both: the authors (in <a href="ch4.html#ch4.1.2">chapter 4.1.2</a>), works (<a href="ch4.html#ch4.1.3">4.1.3</a>), editions (<a href="ch4.html#ch4.1.4">4.1.4</a>), and subgenres (<a href="ch4.html#ch4.1.5">4.1.5</a>) covered. Both the sample size
                        and its relative variability in relation to the sampling frame are
                        assessed.</p>
                     
                     <p id="p463"><span class="paracount w3-blue-grey w3-margin-right"><a href="#p463">463</a></span>In addition, specific overviews are given for the works in
                        Conha19 (in <a href="ch4.html#ch4.1.3.2">4.1.3.2</a>) for
                        features available for the corpus but not for the whole bibliography. These are
                        specific metadata such as the novels’ narrative perspective or status as high-
                        or low-prestige literature, but also characteristics derived from the full
                        texts themselves, such as their length. These overviews thus offer a more
                        descriptive perspective on the corpus. They are nonetheless important because
                        they highlight specific characteristics of the corpus that influence later
                        analyses. This allows for assessing what is typical for the whole corpus and
                        what is a specific result in a particular analysis. Nevertheless, when
                        interpreting the corpus-specific overviews, it must be remembered that these
                        distributions have not been checked against a sampling frame. They are
                        properties of the corpus and do not necessarily allow for generalizations about
                        the novel that the corpus aims to represent.</p>
                     
                     <p id="p464"><span class="paracount w3-blue-grey w3-margin-right"><a href="#p464">464</a></span>Besides the factors of authorship and genre and the work and
                        edition levels, in the overviews, also the chronological aspect is covered. On
                        the one hand, distributions over the years and decades are used to get a sense
                        of the overall production of novels over time and how it is proportionally
                        reflected in the corpus. On the other hand, the question arises of how Bib-ACMé
                        and Conha19 are organized in terms of literary periods. In <a href="ch3.html#ch3.1.3">chapter 3.1.3</a>&nbsp;above, the chronological limits for
                        the whole bibliography and corpus were set to 1830 and 1910, including the
                        first national literary productions and delimiting the corpus from new
                        avantgardistic literary currents arising in the twentieth century. However,
                        during this long nineteenth century, several different literary currents played
                        a major role in Spanish-American novels, particularly Romanticism, Realism,
                        &nbsp;Naturalism, and Modernism. A non-trivial question is how to map these
                        different currents to chronological periods that would allow comparing their
                        relative coverage in the bibliography and the corpus. As Varela Jácome
                        explains, different literary currents of European provenance reached Spanish
                        America with delay and also simultaneously. As a consequence, there are
                        chronological overlaps of works that can be attributed to the different
                        currents and also works that draw their aesthetic influence from several
                        currents at once (<span class="w3-tooltip w3-border-bottom w3-border-blue-grey">Varela

                        in the social and economic life of all the Spanish-American countries, which
                        led to the development of the <em>Modernismo</em> current (<span class="w3-tooltip w3-border-bottom w3-border-blue-grey">Rössner 2007, 200<span class="w3-text w3-tag w3-round w3-blue-grey w3-left-align w3-padding w3-large" style="position:absolute;left:0;bottom:25px">Rössner, Michael. 2007. <em>Lateinamerikanische

                        deciding on clear chronological limits for the various literary currents of the
                        nineteenth century and without needing to establish a temporal sequence of
                        currents, the year 1880 will be used as a cutting point here to see how many
                        works were published before and after that year both in the bibliography and
                        the corpus.</p>

                        and hence also not for the evaluation of representativeness is sampling within
                        the texts themselves. Only whole novels are included in the corpus and not, for
                        example, selected subchapters or randomly selected text snippets of a certain
                        size. As Gemeinböck points out in her study on “Representativeness in Corpora
                        of Literary Texts”, to use extracts of prose fiction is not advisable because,
                        for example, beginnings and endings of the texts would differ considerably. The
                        loss of information about entire text sections is to be considered more
                        problematic than texts of different length (<span class="w3-tooltip w3-border-bottom w3-border-blue-grey">Gemeinböck 2016, 36<span class="w3-text w3-tag w3-round w3-blue-grey w3-left-align w3-padding w3-large" style="position:absolute;left:0;bottom:25px">Gemeinböck, Iris. 2016. “Representativeness in corpora

                        draw on information that is encoded in XML-TEI. Therefore, an XSLT script was

                        easily assessed, for example, exact publication dates versus ranges or
                        relationships between publication dates of editions and the biographical data
                        of authors.</p>

                        following overviews. First, only authors, works, and editions contained in
                        Bib-ACMé and Conha19 are considered without claiming completeness. The sources
                        of both the bibliography the corpus were presented in chapters <a href="ch3.html#ch3.2.1">3.2.1</a>&nbsp;and <a href="ch3.html#ch3.3.1">3.3.1</a>&nbsp;above, respectively. There are probably more
                        authors, works, and above all, more editions that would have been eligible
                        according to the selection criteria. They are, however, not captured because
                        they were not included in the sources selected to create the databases.</p>
                     
                     <p id="p468"><span class="paracount w3-blue-grey w3-margin-right"><a href="#p468">468</a></span>Second, there are more authors, works, and editions in the
                        context of the bibliography and the corpus that were not included because they
                        did not correspond to the selection criteria. For example, an author that is
                        part of the corpus may have published more works after 1910 that are not
                        represented here. So the following overviews concentrate on the authors, works,
                        and editions selected for the purpose of this study but they do not represent
                        the entire literary field.</p>
                     
                     <p id="p469"><span class="paracount w3-blue-grey w3-margin-right"><a href="#p469">469</a></span>Third, in the TEI files of the bibliography and the corpus, there
                        are metadata values that are marked with degrees of certainty. The nationality
                        of an author, for example, may have been assigned with low certainty if it was
                        implied from source information but could not be verified, for instance, by an
                        entry in an authority file. Such values with lesser degrees of certainty are
                        not reflected in the overviews but are counted in as if they were certain. Then
                        again, there are also completely unknown metadata values. Their number in turn
                        is mentioned or included in the overview figures.</p>
                     
                     <p id="p470"><span class="paracount w3-blue-grey w3-margin-right"><a href="#p470">470</a></span>The analysis of the metadata on the bibliography and the corpus
                        has produced many overview graphs since the two resources have been studied
                        from many different perspectives to paint as comprehensive a picture as
                        possible of their characteristics. In order to still keep the text in this
                        chapter readable, it was decided to describe the results in the text but to
                        outsource the actual graphs, which can be found in the appendix to this

                        crime and gaucho novels. He is followed by the Mexican author of historical
                        novels Enrique Olavarría y Ferrari with 22 works, and Ireneo Paz with 17 works,
                        a Mexican author who wrote historical as well as sentimental novels. More
                        authors mainly dedicated to historical novels are part of the top positions in

                        writer of Realist novels Carlos María Ocantos with 13 works, the Mexican
                        Naturalist Federico Gamboa with 8 novels, and the Mexican writer of
                        <em>novelas de costumbres</em> José Tomás de Cuéllar with 10 novels, who
                        are all well-known. On the other hand, there are some lesser-known authors of
                        mainly sentimental and romantic novels who were very productive in their time:
                        the Cuban authors Virginia Felicia Auber de Noya, Francisco Puig y de la Puente
                        (11 novels each), Teodoro Guerrero y Pallarés (8 novels), José Güell y Renté,
                        and Álvaro de la Iglesia (7 novels each), as well as the Mexican writer José
                        Rivera y Río (10 novels). Together with both lesser-known authors of historical
                        novels Enrique Olavarría y Ferrari and Victoriano Salado Álvarez, all of them
                        are highlighted in blue and thus not part of the top list of the corpus.</p>

                        Federico Gamboa and Carlos María Ocantos with 8 novels each, and the famous
                        Cuban writer Gertrudis Gómez de Avellaneda with 7 novels, who ranges a bit
                        lower in the top list of Bib-ACMé. Authors that entered the top list of the
                        corpus but not of the bibliography are the Mexicans Ignacio Manuel Altamirano

                        are all well-known authors who entered the general literary-historical canon of
                        the countries in question. Sicardi reaches a top place because he wrote a cycle
                        of five novels called “Libro extraño”, which is completely included in the
                        corpus, and Sánchez Mármol because there is a recent edition of his complete

                        bibliography, many of the writers who wrote much did so in specific subgenres
                        of the novel. In addition, some lesser-known authors are prolific writers. On
                        the other side, in the top list of the corpus, well-known canonical authors
                        play a more important role, and specific subgenres are a little less important.
                        This has very practical reasons: the corpus is built as much as possible on
                        novels that were available in a digital full-text format and to date, there are
                        more such digital editions of works written by the more prominent authors.</p>

                        not so much a sign of productivity but of success, be it because the works were

                     <p id="p477"><span class="paracount w3-blue-grey w3-margin-right"><a href="#p477">477</a></span>Most authors in the bibliography have only published one edition
                        (191 authors, i.e., 50&nbsp;%). 148 authors (39&nbsp;%) published two to five editions,
                        and 44 (11&nbsp;%) authors more than five editions. In the corpus, 41 authors (34&nbsp;%
                        of all the authors in the corpus) are represented with one edition, 54 authors
                        (45&nbsp;%) with two to five, and 26 authors (21&nbsp;%) with more than five editions. If
                        one compares the proportion of authors represented with a certain number of
                        editions in Conha19 and Bib-ACMé, the numbers show that the corpus contains
                        fewer authors with only one edition, a bit more with two to five editions, and
                        considerably more with more than five editions. The numbers of editions
                        indicate that the works contained in the corpus were, on average, republished
                        more often than the works in the bibliography. All in all, the authors in the
                        corpus were more popular, more successful, or had more prestige than the
                        average author in general. This observation is in line with the above finding
                        that the authors represented with most works in the corpus are the ones that
                        are more known and more canonized. The same picture emerges when looking at the
                        list of authors with most editions in Bib-ACMé and Conha19, represented in <a href="#tab22">table 22</a>.<sup id="ftn375" class="w3-btn w3-theme-l3 w3-circle" onclick="document.getElementById('ftn375-modal').style.display='block'">375</sup>

                        lists of the authors with the most editions differ less between the
                        bibliography and the corpus. Only five authors instead of nine are not
                        contained in the other list, respectively. This is because, by the number of
                        editions, more of the well-known and successful authors enter the bibliography
                        list, although they are not the ones that wrote most works. These are the
                        Mexicans Ignacio Manuel Altamirano and Rafael Delgado and the Cuban author
                        Cirilo Villaverde. Authors that newly enter the corpus top list are the
                        Argentine José Mármol, the Mexican Manuel Payno, and the Cuban author Teodoro
                        Guerrero y Pallaŕes. José Mármol is famous for just one novel, “Amalia”, which
                        was very successful. Manuel Payno published three works, two of which were
                        successes (“El fistol del diablo” and “Los bandidos de Río Frío”) and re-edited
                        in his time. Teodoro Guerrero y Pallarés enters the list because he wrote many
                        novels, of which several were published with more than one edition, especially
                        “Anatomía del corazón”. New to both top lists is the Mexican Juan Díaz
                        Covarrubias, author of three novels that were all re-edited. So in terms of
                        quantity, the field of top authors shifts when considering the number of
                        editions instead of the number of works, bringing the bibliography and the
                        corpus closer together.</p>

                        and Conha19 are their provenance, nationality, and belonging to a certain
                        country because both resources include authors&nbsp;from Argentina, Cuba, and
                        Mexico.<sup id="ftn376" class="w3-btn w3-theme-l3 w3-circle" onclick="document.getElementById('ftn376-modal').style.display='block'">376</sup></p>

                        Argentina. In Conha19, in contrast, there are more authors belonging to
                        Argentina than to Mexico. However, the numbers for these two countries range
                        between 37 and 46&nbsp;%, so the difference is not too big. In both cases, there
                        &nbsp;are fewer authors that are connected to Cuba, 14&nbsp;% in the bibliography and
                        20&nbsp;% in the corpus, meaning that Cuban authors are a bit overrepresented in the
                        latter.</p>
                     
                     <p id="p481"><span class="paracount w3-blue-grey w3-margin-right"><a href="#p481">481</a></span>The division into three countries is a simplification because
                        authors were assigned to the countries based on several different criteria.
                        They can, for example, have the nationality of the country, either because they
                        were born there or naturalized at some point, or they are considered as
                        belonging to the country because it was their primary place of residence and
                        work and they published their novels there. A closer look into the
                        nationalities, birth, and death places shows that also other countries beyond
                        Argentina, Cuba, and Mexico are involved.<sup id="ftn377" class="w3-btn w3-theme-l3 w3-circle" onclick="document.getElementById('ftn377-modal').style.display='block'">377</sup></p>
                     
                     <p id="p482"><span class="paracount w3-blue-grey w3-margin-right"><a href="#p482">482</a></span>By nationality, most authors are Mexican, Argentina, and Cuban in
                        the bibliography, and Argentine, Mexican, and Cuban in the corpus. Besides
                        that, also authors with Spanish nationality play a role in both contexts. In
                        the corpus, further nationalities are only represented by one author each
                        (Chilean, Dominican, French, and Uruguayan). The nationality of one author in
                        the corpus is unknown (C. M. Blanco, whose novel “Salvaje. Novela argentina”
                        was published in Barcelona and Buenos Aires in 1891). In the bibliography,
                        there are seven authors with Uruguayan nationality, two each with Chilean,
                        Dominican, and French nationality, and further nationalities represented with
                        just one author. In Bib-ACMé, the nationality of seven authors is unknown.
                        Altogether, twelve different nationalities are involved.</p>
                     
                     <p id="p483"><span class="paracount w3-blue-grey w3-margin-right"><a href="#p483">483</a></span>The picture is different when the authors’ countries of birth are
                        considered. For most authors in the bibliography (44&nbsp;%), the place of birth
                        could not be verified. Otherwise, most authors included in Bib-ACMé are born in
                        Mexico, followed by Argentina, Cuba, and then Spain and Uruguay. Interestingly,
                        the proportion of authors born in Argentina (12&nbsp;%) is only slightly higher than
                        the proportion of authors born in Cuba (10&nbsp;%). However, more authors were
                        associated with Argentina because they were included in the source
                        bibliographies, especially the comprehensive bibliography of the Argentine
                        novel by Lichtblau, and because their works were published in Argentina, but
                        there is not much knowledge about many of these authors. In the corpus, the
                        order of countries of birth is the same as in the bibliography (Mexico,
                        Argentina, Cuba, Spain, Uruguay), but the proportion of authors with unknown
                        countries of birth is much less (13&nbsp;%). This again illustrates that the corpus
                        authors are mainly well-known writers or at least that their share is bigger
                        than in the bibliography.</p>
                     
                     <p id="p484"><span class="paracount w3-blue-grey w3-margin-right"><a href="#p484">484</a></span>The country of death is also unknown for most authors in the
                        bibliography (48&nbsp;%), followed by Mexico, Argentina, Cuba, and Spain. A country
                        that gains a bit more relevance as a place of death is the USA, where six
                        authors died. These are authors born in Cuba, Mexico, and the Dominican
                        Republic. In the corpus, again, the place of death is known for many more
                        authors (it is unknown for only 14&nbsp;%). Besides that, the proportion of authors
                        who died in Argentina and Mexico is equal, followed by Cuba, Spain, and the
                        USA, where four of the authors died. The overviews of the relationships between
                        authors and countries make clear that the Argentine, Cuban, and Mexican
                        literatures, as understood in the context of this study, are not fixed and
                        closed spaces, but that connections to other countries exist, as is probably
                        the case for all “national” literatures.</p>

                        the great majority is male (353 authors, i.e., 92&nbsp;%), and there are only 23
                        (6&nbsp;%) female authors. In 7 cases (2&nbsp;%), the gender of the author is unknown. In
                        the corpus, the proportion of female authors is a bit higher (11 authors, i.e.,
                        9&nbsp;%), and there is only one author whose gender is unknown (the author of the
                        novel “Salvaje”, called “C. M. Blanco”).<sup id="ftn378" class="w3-btn w3-theme-l3 w3-circle" onclick="document.getElementById('ftn378-modal').style.display='block'">378</sup>

                        particular gender there are but also for how many of the works they are
                        responsible. In the bibliography, 756 works (91&nbsp;%) are written by male authors,
                        58 works (7&nbsp;%) by female authors, and 15 works (2&nbsp;%) by authors of unknown
                        gender. In the corpus, 229 novels (89&nbsp;%) are written by male authors, 26 novels
                        (10&nbsp;%) by female authors, and one novel by an author of unknown gender. If one
                        compares these numbers to the number of authors in general, it can be noted
                        that, on average, female authors are slightly more productive than male
                        authors.</p>

                        which authors are included in the bibliography and the corpus. Unfortunately,
                        they could only be verified for a subset of the authors.<sup id="ftn379" class="w3-btn w3-theme-l3 w3-circle" onclick="document.getElementById('ftn379-modal').style.display='block'">379</sup></p>

                        only known for 63&nbsp;% of the authors in the bibliography and for 88&nbsp;% of the
                        authors in the corpus. No life dates at all are known for 33&nbsp;% of the authors
                        in the bibliography and 8&nbsp;% in the corpus. For 4&nbsp;% of the authors in Bib-ACMé
                        and 3&nbsp;% in Conha19, only the year of birth or death is known. That much more is
                        known about the life dates of the authors in the corpus than in the
                        bibliography again shows that the latter covers more of the less canonized
                        literary production. This state of knowledge has to be kept in mind for the
                        following overviews, in which life dates are used to calculate how many authors
                        were alive or active at a certain point in time and how old they were when they
                        published their works.<sup id="ftn380" class="w3-btn w3-theme-l3 w3-circle" onclick="document.getElementById('ftn380-modal').style.display='block'">380</sup></p>

                        the Mexican José Joaquín Fernández de Lizardi. He was also the first author who
                        died (in 1827). Lizardi is often considered the author of the first Mexican or
                        even Spanish-American novel “El Periquillo Sarniento” (1816, MX). On the other
                        hand, his novels are also described as forerunners of the nineteenth-century

                        this study, the novel “El Periquillo Sarniento” is not included here. In the
                        bibliography, Lizardi is only represented with the novel “Don Catrín de la

                        included in the corpus. The next author, included in both the bibliography and
                        the corpus, is the Cuban Esteban Pichardo y Tapia, born in 1799. In the
                        following decades, the number of births increases considerably. More than half
                        of the authors in the bibliography and the corpus whose birth dates are known
                        were born between the 1830s and the 1860s. The last authors were born in the

                        who was born in 1880. Considering the years of death, after Lizardi, the first
                        authors died in the 1850s, and the last ones in the 1960s. The first author in
                        the corpus who died was Juan Díaz Covarrubias, a Mexican writer who died in

                        Enrique Larreta, who died in 1960. Most authors died in the 1890s, 1910s, and
                        1920s. Without detailed biographic research, it cannot be said with certainty
                        why there were fewer deaths in the 1900s than in the preceding decade and the
                        following two decades. It may have had an influence that the 1900s were a
                        politically and economically more stable decade than the others. All in all,
                        the life dates of the authors comprise 190 years, from the 1770s to the 1960s,
                        for a bibliography and corpus that is limited to 80 years. In such a broad
                        range, several generations of authors are involved, and not all the authors
                        experienced the same historical times. Nevertheless, there is a core of
                        contemporaneity. Between the 1850s and the 1910s, more than half of the authors
                        for whom birth and death dates are known were alive.<sup id="ftn381" class="w3-btn w3-theme-l3 w3-circle" onclick="document.getElementById('ftn381-modal').style.display='block'">381</sup></p>

                        also active. “Activity” is interpreted here as the phase when the authors
                        published new works, i.e., the years in which they actually published or in
                        which they already had and still were to publish more works.<sup id="ftn382" class="w3-btn w3-theme-l3 w3-circle" onclick="document.getElementById('ftn382-modal').style.display='block'">382</sup> Compared to the top period of authors alive, the most
                        authors that were active at the same time are to be found later, in the 1880s
                        and the 1890s. For the bibliography, the top is reached in the years 1886 and
                        1887, when 53 authors (22&nbsp;% of all the authors with known life dates) were
                        active at the same time. In the corpus, the top year is 1884, with 33 authors
                        (31&nbsp;%). It becomes clear that the bibliography and corpus are closer together
                        in the early decades, meaning that the coverage of authors (at least of the
                        ones with known life dates) is better in this phase. Although the corpus
                        includes more authors that were active in the later decades, there are even
                        more in the bibliography, showing that the overall number of active authors and
                        works published increased considerably towards the end of the century.</p>

                        1850s, it makes sense that most of them were active in the 1880s. The youngest
                        author at publication was Carlos María Ocantos, whose novel “El esclavo” was

                        contained in the bibliography and those included in the corpus. About one-third
                        of the authors in Bib-ACMé are also represented in Conha19. Most of the authors
                        only published one work between 1830 and 1910, of which, in most cases, also
                        only one edition was produced. This is probably not the impression one gets
                        when reading literary histories, where the center of interest is often on the
                        minority of more productive, well-known authors. These are a bit
                        overrepresented in the corpus when the number of works and also editions are
                        considered. However, there are some also lesser-known authors who wrote much,
                        which are more present in the bibliography than in the corpus. Regarding the
                        distribution of authors by country, there are no big differences between the
                        bibliography and the corpus. In the latter, there are relatively more Argentine
                        authors and fewer Mexican authors than in the bibliography. Furthermore, Cuban
                        authors are a bit overrepresented in the corpus, although they are the smallest
                        group. Additional countries play a role in the nationalities of the authors and
                        as countries of birth and death, especially Spain, but they range below 10&nbsp;% of
                        the authors. Regarding gender, there are relatively more female authors in the
                        corpus than in the bibliography, but the difference is only about 3&nbsp;%. The life
                        dates of the authors were also evaluated and not much difference was found
                        between authors in Bib-ACMé and Conha19. Most authors lived between the 1850s
                        and the 1910s, and most were active in the 1880s and 1890s. The average age of
                        an author when publishing a work is the same in the bibliography and the
                        corpus, and the age of death of the authors also only differs by one year.</p>

                           between 1830 and 1910. The first work in the bibliography is from the year
                           1832, and in the corpus, there are two works first published in 1839. The
                           last works in both Bib-ACMé and Conha19 were published in 1910. Apart from
                           the 1830s, when only a few works were published, almost all the years are
                           covered in the bibliography. Exceptions are the years 1849, 1852, and 1867.
                           As the numbers were generally low in the 1840s and the early 1850s, it is
                           possible that no novels at all were published in 1849 and 1852. In the year
                           1867, however, it is surprising. It may be the case that the political
                           situation in the three countries made it difficult for authors to write or
                           publish novels in that year. During the time, Argentina was involved in the
                           War of the Triple Alliance, Cuba stood at the beginning of a period of
                           internal wars, and in Mexico, the emperor Maximilian was overthrown by
                           liberal troops. However, verifying that this had an effect on the number of
                           novels that were published would require more research into the personal
                           circumstances of the authors and the history of the publishing sector. Other
                           years that are not represented in the corpus are some of the years in the
                           1830s, 1845, 1850, 1853, 1863, and 1878. Apart from the 1830s, for which it
                           is more difficult to access the few novels that were published, this is
                           interpreted as the effect of random selection. The number of works published
                           increased considerably towards the end of the century. From 1880 on, at
                           least ten works were published per year.</p>

                           the 1890s, the share of works in the corpus is about one-third, which
                           corresponds to the overall proportion of works included in the corpus. The
                           1860s are slightly overrepresented with 39&nbsp;%. In the margins, i.e., the
                           early and late decades, the numbers deviate more. The 1830s, 1900s, and
                           1910s are underrepresented in the corpus, and the 1840s are strongly
                           overrepresented. Apart from the 1900s, such deviations are more likely in
                           these decades because the overall number of works is much lower than in the
                           central decades.</p>

                           works in the bibliography are also part of the corpus. This means that the
                           corpus contains proportionally fewer works in the period after 1880,
                           although in total, more works were published in the later decades of the

                           over the decades is observed that way, different patterns become visible. In
                           Argentina, the number of works exploded in the 1880s. According to the
                           bibliography, 90 works were published in that decade, compared to around 20
                           works each in the three decades before. Apart from the 1830s, for which only
                           one work is included in the bibliography, all the decades are also
                           represented in the corpus. For Argentina, of the central decades, the 1870s
                           are overrepresented and the 1900s underrepresented. In Mexico, the number of
                           works published rose earlier and not so sharply. Considerably more works
                           were published from the 1860s onwards, and their number increased towards
                           the end of the century, whereas in Argentina, the number decreased again
                           after the 1880s. Regarding the decades with many works, the 1860s are
                           overrepresented for Mexico in the corpus. As for Argentina, no work from the
                           1830s is included in the corpus. In contrast to Argentina and Mexico, the
                           number of Cuban works published between 1830 and 1910 does not show
                           significant growth. Actually, most works that are included in the
                           bibliography were published in the 1850s (28 works), followed by the 1890s
                           (21 works). Compared to Argentina and Mexico, more Cuban works were
                           published in the early decades, from the 1830s to the 1850s. It is very
                           probable that this different development of the number of published novels
                           in the course of the nineteenth century is due to Cuba’s status as a colony,
                           which only ceased in 1898, and which prevented the growth of the literature
                           marked. On the other hand, Cuba was colonized early and had a close
                           connection to its motherland Spain, which could explain why relatively more
                           novels were published in the early decades by Cuban-Spanish than by
                           Argentine and Mexican authors. However, the quality of the bibliographic
                           sources used can also play a role, as discussed above in <a href="ch3.html#ch3.2.1">chapter 3.2.1</a>. Comparing the
                           overall number of works by country, most novels in Bib-ACMé and also in
                           Conha19 are Mexican, followed closely by Argentine novels. The Cuban novels
                           make up the smallest part, with 16 and 19&nbsp;%, respectively.<sup id="ftn389" class="w3-btn w3-theme-l3 w3-circle" onclick="document.getElementById('ftn389-modal').style.display='block'">389</sup></p>

                           Apart from the lowest numbers, there is no difference between the

                           novels’ first editions were published. Most novels were first published in
                           Mexico, followed by Argentina, Cuba, Spain, France, and the USA. Comparing

                           than the one after this year. Regarding the countries, there are relatively
                           more Argentine and Cuban and fewer Mexican works in the corpus than in the
                           bibliography, but these differences range only between 2 to 6&nbsp;%. As to the
                           overall distribution of works over time, almost all the years between 1830
                           and 1910 are covered in the bibliography and the corpus, with the exception
                           of some early years from the 1830s to the early 1850s, plus the exceptional
                           year 1867, in which no works were published. Especially from the 1880s
                           onwards, the number of works published increased considerably. However, this
                           development is not the same in all three countries. In Argentina, most works
                           were published in the 1880s; in Mexico, the number of works grew already in
                           the 1860s; and in Cuba, no significant growth over time can be recognized at
                           all.</p>

                           are only available in the corpus. Such aspects are analyzed in this chapter.
                           Part of the metadata that was gathered for the corpus refers to technical
                           and administrative aspects, such as the type of source medium, the kind of

                           are classified as high prestige and 82 novels (32&nbsp;%) as low prestige. There
                           is no difference in the proportion of high- and low-prestige novels from
                           Cuba, but from Mexico there are more high-prestige novels, and from

                           Surely, the quality of the bibliographic sources used as a basis for
                           selecting novels for the corpus is an influencing factor. The bibliography
                           of the Argentine novel authored by Lichtblau is very comprehensive and also
                           includes many authors and works that are not well-known. Furthermore, the
                           state of digitization and access to digital sources plays a role. The
                           collection of Argentine novels published on Wikimedia Commons by the
                           Argentina Academy also contains many works written by lesser-known authors.
                           Independently of the reasons, the corpus has a certain bias towards
                           low-prestige Argentine and high-prestige Mexican novels.</p>

                           low-prestige novels were included in the 1890s, 1880s, and 1860s. On the
                           other hand, low-prestige novels are underrepresented in the 1840s, 1870s,
                           and the 1900s. The decades 1830 and 1910 are not really informative because
                           the number of works in them is so small. It makes sense that in the decades
                           in which the overall production of novels increased considerably, more
                           low-prestige novels were produced and were also selected for the corpus.
                           Regarding the 1900s, they are, in general, underrepresented in Conha19<sup id="ftn394" class="w3-btn w3-theme-l3 w3-circle" onclick="document.getElementById('ftn394-modal').style.display='block'">394</sup>, so the probability of
                           selecting high-prestige works is higher. The 1840s, in contrast, are
                           generally represented quite well in Conha19<sup id="ftn395" class="w3-btn w3-theme-l3 w3-circle" onclick="document.getElementById('ftn395-modal').style.display='block'">395</sup>, so it can be assumed that there were not many works in
                           that decade that are considered low-prestige today, or if there were, they
                           are not known. Why low-prestige works are underrepresented in the 1870s is
                           not clear. Summarized to the two periods before and in or after 1880, the
                           proportion of low-prestige works is higher in and after 1880.</p>

                           the narrative perspective of the novels. In general, there are 44 novels
                           (17&nbsp;%) with a first-person narrator and 212 novels (83&nbsp;%) with a
                           third-person narrator, so the latter clearly prevails. Regarding the
                           distribution of the narrative perspective by country, it is interesting that
                           the proportion of Cuban novels is much lower for the novels narrated in the
                           first person than for those narrated in the third person. A hypothesis is
                           that the individual, personal perspective was not so suitable for novels
                           published in the colony. The first-person novels are mainly Argentine,
                           closely followed by the Mexican novels, and the third-person novels are
                           above all Mexican.<sup id="ftn396" class="w3-btn w3-theme-l3 w3-circle" onclick="document.getElementById('ftn396-modal').style.display='block'">396</sup></p>

                           becomes visible that the proportion of novels written in the first person
                           was highest in the 1870s, 1890s, and 1880s. No first-person novel is
                           included from the 1850s, and also the 1840s and 1900s are mostly represented
                           with novels narrated in the third person. The drop of first-person novels in
                           the 1900s is surprising because otherwise, they became more frequent after
                           the middle of the nineteenth century. Again, this decade is generally
                           underrepresented in the corpus, which might be a reason. Comparing the
                           period before 1880 to the one in and after 1880 shows that narrations in the
                           first person are relatively and absolutely more frequent in the latter
                           period, although the difference between the two periods only amounts to
                           6&nbsp;%.</p>

                           Other places the novels are set in are the European countries Spain, Italy,
                           France, Greece, Switzerland, the USA, and other South-American countries
                           (Peru, Chile, Bolivia, Brazil, and Uruguay). Together, American countries

                           novels in this aspect. Analysis of the metadata shows that this is indeed
                           the case.<sup id="ftn399" class="w3-btn w3-theme-l3 w3-circle" onclick="document.getElementById('ftn399-modal').style.display='block'">399</sup> While the
                           proportions of Mexican, Argentine, and Cuban novels set in America
                           correspond largely to the general significance of these countries in the
                           corpus, the numbers are quite different for the novels set in Europe. Here,
                           the majority is Cuban and the minority Mexican, suggesting that Cuba’s
                           status as a colony during most of the nineteenth century had an influence on
                           the setting of the novels. In addition, the relationship between Argentina
                           and Europe was closer than that between Mexico and Europe as regards the
                           choice of setting for the fictional texts. However, in absolute numbers,
                           only 24 novels are set in Europe, so these trends should also not be
                           overinterpreted. Following the proportions of works set in Europe over the
                           decades and comparing their share in the period before 1880 and in or after
                           that year makes clear that the number of works set in Europe decreased over
                           time. Moreover, at least in the corpus, the 1860s were already a decade in
                           which an American setting was clearly preferred.<sup id="ftn400" class="w3-btn w3-theme-l3 w3-circle" onclick="document.getElementById('ftn400-modal').style.display='block'">400</sup></p>

                           time period covered by the novels is registered in the metadata. Three time
                           periods are distinguished: contemporary, recent past, and past. For each
                           novel, two values were encoded: the time period relative to the author’s
                           birth year and relative to the year of the first known publication of the

                           From both points of view, a contemporary setting is the most frequent one:
                           related to the authors’ birth years in 82&nbsp;% and relative to the publication
                           date in 73&nbsp;% of the cases. Novels set in the past are the second most
                           frequent group, with 13&nbsp;% and 16&nbsp;%, respectively. The recent past is treated
                           in 4&nbsp;% of the novels when the authors’ birth years are concerned and in 11&nbsp;%
                           of the works when the publication year is decisive. The differences between
                           the two approaches show that more novels treat a period that is past in
                           relation to the publication date but still part of the contemporary
                           experience of the authors. Fewer novels treat a period that lies in a more
                           distant past. In the following, only the approach of comparing the
                           publication date to the time period covered by the novels is considered

                           striking concerning a setting in the recent past. Here, Mexican novels are
                           overrepresented by 8&nbsp;% and Cuban novels by 10&nbsp;%, while Argentine novels are
                           underrepresented by 18&nbsp;%. All in all, the past is more a topic in the
                           Mexican and Cuban novels, and the recent past is relatively most important
                           in the latter ones, while the contemporary perspective is favored in the
                           Argentine novels. This might be explained by the fact that the colonial
                           history of Cuba and Mexico is longer than that of the Argentine region. In
                           the case of Cuba, another factor is the difficulty of broaching contemporary
                           issues in a country that was still under the control of the mother country,
                           which may have led to a preference for representing the recent past. On the
                           other side, Argentine society and economy developed rapidly in the
                           nineteenth century, which supplied much material for the novels treating the

                           was favored more in the 1860s and then again in the 1900s. Leaving out the
                           first and last decades with very few works, also the recent past reaches the
                           top positions in these two decades. The lowest proportions of novels
                           treating the past and recent past can be seen in the 1880s and 1890s. So a
                           first trend of treating historical issues came up shortly after independence
                           was reached in most Spanish-American countries, probably as a way of
                           contributing to writing their own history in literary terms. Then, in the
                           decades of significant social and economic development, contemporary issues
                           were more relevant. A return to a greater interest in the recent and further
                           past at the beginning of the new century marks a new phase.<sup id="ftn405" class="w3-btn w3-theme-l3 w3-circle" onclick="document.getElementById('ftn405-modal').style.display='block'">405</sup> Condensing this development to the phase
                           before and after 1880 results in relatively more novels treating the
                           contemporary period in the latter and some form of the past in the

                           metadata is the length of the texts. In the context of the definition of
                           boundaries of the novel, the minimum length of novels was discussed in
                           detail in <a href="ch3.html#ch3.1.1.4">chapter

                           the corpus, the question remains how long these actually are in terms of the
                           number of tokens.<sup id="ftn406" class="w3-btn w3-theme-l3 w3-circle" onclick="document.getElementById('ftn406-modal').style.display='block'">406</sup> The shortest novel in the corpus has about 16,000

                           Argentine, Mexican, and Cuban novels, as defined here, tend to be shorter
                           than the typical English novel that Forster had in mind. 25&nbsp;% of the novels
                           are between 16,000 and 35,000 tokens long, the next 25&nbsp;% between 35,000 and

                           the last one between 96,000 and 331,000 tokens, so the spread of lengths
                           increases considerably for the upper 50&nbsp;% of the novels and the longest

                           so they are both shorter than the overall median novel. The longest
                           Argentine novel has 231,000 tokens, and the longest Cuban novel has 198,000

                           novel is 67,000 tokens long, and the three longest novels with over 300,000
                           tokens are also Mexican. The three longest novels are historical novels, so
                           it should be examined if there is a correlation between the length of the

                           1830 to 1850, the median length drops from 110,000 to 36,000 tokens. In the
                           1860s, it jumps to 87,000 tokens, and after that, it raises from 47,000 in
                           the 1870s to 99,000 in the 1910s. The works in the 1830s and 1910s are very
                           few, though. Regarding the median, it is especially interesting to see the
                           exceptional decade of the 1860s. As was found out in the evaluation of the
                           time periods of the novels’ settings, in this decade, representations of the
                           past were relatively favored. In addition, they were preferred in Mexican
                           novels, and these were more numerous in the 1860s than Argentine and Cuban
                           novels.<sup id="ftn411" class="w3-btn w3-theme-l3 w3-circle" onclick="document.getElementById('ftn411-modal').style.display='block'">411</sup> Together with the observation that the longest novels of

                           long novels in this decade than in the others. A test for statistical
                           significance reveals that the text lengths can be considered significantly
                           different in the following constellations of decades: 1860s versus 1870s,
                           1860s versus 1880s, and 1880s versus 1900s.<sup id="ftn412" class="w3-btn w3-theme-l3 w3-circle" onclick="document.getElementById('ftn412-modal').style.display='block'">412</sup> It is also noteworthy
                           to see that the variability of the texts’ length (in terms of the spread of
                           length in the two central quartiles) is lower from the 1870s to the 1890s
                           than before and after that decade. In the last three decades of the

                        bibliography and the corpus. This means that many works that were first
                        published in Mexico, Argentina, or Cuba, were republished in Spain.</p>
                     
                     <p id="p520"><span class="paracount w3-blue-grey w3-margin-right"><a href="#p520">520</a></span>The most important cities of publication were the three capitals
                        Mexico (34&nbsp;% of all the editions), Buenos Aires (33&nbsp;%), and Havana (8&nbsp;%). In
                        the corpus, Buenos Aires outranks Mexico. Given that the corpus contains more
                        works associated with Mexico (42&nbsp;%) than with Argentina (39&nbsp;%), this means that
                        the Mexican works contained in the corpus were more often published elsewhere
                        than Argentine works, be it in another Mexican city or in another country.
                        Right after the three capitals, the Spanish cities Barcelona (6&nbsp;% of the
                        editions) and Madrid (4&nbsp;%) follow, and Paris (3&nbsp;%) occupies the sixth rank.
                        These numbers and also the whole list of cities illustrate that the publishing
                        of the novels was centralized to a high degree and that European metropolises
                        also played a role in the distribution of the novels. On the other hand, there
                        is also a long list of individual publication places, showing a greater
                        diversity of local and foreign publishing activity, if not quantitatively, at
                        least qualitatively. There are, for instance, 32 different Mexican, 11
                        Argentine, and 10 Cuban publication places.</p>
                     
                     <p id="p521"><span class="paracount w3-blue-grey w3-margin-right"><a href="#p521">521</a></span>To summarize, comparing the number of editions in the corpus and
                        the bibliography to the number of works contained in both, the corpus involves
                        relatively more editions, meaning that the works in the corpus were republished
                        more often than the average work in the whole bibliography. Relatively, the
                        numbers of editions over time are comparable to the numbers of works. Regarding
                        the number of editions, the period before 1880 is a bit better represented in
                        the corpus than the period after that year, but the difference between the two
                        periods is smaller than in the case of the works. Considering the countries and
                        places of publication of the editions, Spain plays a bigger role when all the
                        editions are considered and not only the first editions of the works. The main
                        places of publication are the three capitals of the countries selected for the
                        bibliography and corpus, followed by European cities and a whole range of other
                        publication places of minor importance.</p>

                        in the bibliography and the corpus are assigned. According to the model of
                        subgenre terms developed in <a href="ch3.html#ch3.2.3">chapter
                           3.2.3</a>&nbsp; above, a distinction is made between explicit subgenre signals
                        that are directly mentioned in titles and other paratexts of the novels and
                        implicit signals that were inferred from them. Furthermore, labels that are
                        signaled (explicitly or implicitly) are differentiated from labels that were
                        assigned to the novels by literary historians. In addition and cross to the
                        above distinctions, the subgenre labels are organized into several semiotically
                        justified levels (theme, current, identity, and several modes of the medial and
                        syntactic realization and the communicational frame). If not otherwise stated,
                        multiple assignments of subgenre labels are all counted in.</p>

                           carry an explicit (sub)generic signal of any kind, while 207 novels do not
                           carry any explicit signal at all. In the corpus, 204 novels (80&nbsp;% of all the
                           novels in the corpus) have an explicit signal. The explicit label “novela”
                           is carried by 404 (49&nbsp;%) of the novels in the bibliography and by 134 (52&nbsp;%)
                           of the novels in the corpus. How can this be interpreted? Either the novel,
                           as defined here, is a genre that is so self-evident that its representatives
                           do not need the explicit denomination to be recognized, or it is so vaguely
                           defined that as many other texts are covered by it. However, as information
                           about almost all the works in Bib-ACMé and Conha19 was retrieved from
                           relevant bibliographies and literary histories of the novel, the former
                           aspect is more plausible.<sup id="ftn417" class="w3-btn w3-theme-l3 w3-circle" onclick="document.getElementById('ftn417-modal').style.display='block'">417</sup> In what

                           rarer, suggesting a change in the conventions of labeling the works over
                           time.<sup id="ftn419" class="w3-btn w3-theme-l3 w3-circle" onclick="document.getElementById('ftn419-modal').style.display='block'">419</sup> However, both types of works, those with and without

                           the bibliography. Although these labels are called “explicit” here, they do
                           not correspond exactly to the historical denominations used to mark the
                           novels because the values were normalized in order to be comparable. Part of
                           this normalization is that compound labels were split up, and each part was
                           marked up separately.<sup id="ftn420" class="w3-btn w3-theme-l3 w3-circle" onclick="document.getElementById('ftn420-modal').style.display='block'">420</sup> The

                           label “novela” is the most frequent one. The other top explicit labels are
                           of different kinds. Some labels are directly related to the themes of the
                           novels and are recognizable as subgenres of the novel: “novela histórica”
                           (on rank 2 in the bibliography), “novela de costumbres” (rank 5), “novela
                           social” (rank 13), and “novela policial” (rank 17). Labels referring to the
                           linguistic and cultural identity of the novels also recur in this top list:
                           “novela original” (rank 3), “novela mexicana” (rank 4), “novela cubana”
                           (rank 9), “novela nacional” (rank 11), “novela argentina” (rank 15), and
                           “novela americana” (rank 16). Of the remaining labels, several are (not
                           exclusively, but often) related to different kinds of historical novels:
                           “episodios” (rank 6), “memorias” (rank 7), “leyenda” (rank 8), and
                           “historia” (rank 12). The labels “escenas” (rank 18) and “cuadros” (rank 19)
                           are often connected to novels of customs. Interestingly, also labels
                           designating other genres, such as “drama” (rank 10), “cuento” (rank 14), and
                           “ensayo” (rank 20), are among the top labels for the novel.</p>
                        
                        <p id="p525"><span class="paracount w3-blue-grey w3-margin-right"><a href="#p525">525</a></span>For the corpus, the ranks of explicit labels are similar, but
                           there are also a few differences.<sup id="ftn422" class="w3-btn w3-theme-l3 w3-circle" onclick="document.getElementById('ftn422-modal').style.display='block'">422</sup> Labels that are in the top 20 for the corpus but not for
                           the bibliography are “estudio” (rank 15), “novela realista” (rank 18),
                           “crónica” (rank 19), and “novela militar” (rank 20). On the other hand,
                           labels that are in the bibliography top 20 list but not in the corresponding
                           corpus list are “novela nacional”, “novela policial”, “escenas”, and
                           “ensayo”. When the first ranks of the bibliography and corpus lists are
                           compared, differences are, for example, that the number of “novelas
                           históricas” is almost equal to the “novelas de costumbres” in the corpus,
                           whereas it is around twice as high in the bibliography. Furthermore, “novela
                           cubana” is on rank 6 in the corpus compared to rank 9 in the
                           bibliography.</p>
                        
                        <p id="p526"><span class="paracount w3-blue-grey w3-margin-right"><a href="#p526">526</a></span>Analyzing the top explicit subgenre labels brings to light
                           several characteristics of the novels in the bibliography and the corpus.
                           First, the most prominent explicitly marked subgenre is the historical
                           novel, both according to the number of occurrences of the literal label and
                           also based on several other subgenre labels related to it, which leads to
                           the conclusion that the most prominent subgenres are historical novels.
                           Second, there was an evident need to explicitly mark the linguistic,
                           cultural, or national identity of the novels. As there are so many different
                           kinds of <em>identity labels</em>, it is of interest to check how many
                           novels carried such labels. In the bibliography, 272 novels (33&nbsp;%) had an
                           identity label, and in the corpus, 100 novels (39&nbsp;%). As with the general
                           label “novela”, also here the question arises if the use of identity labels
                           depends on the period of publication of the novels.<sup id="ftn423" class="w3-btn w3-theme-l3 w3-circle" onclick="document.getElementById('ftn423-modal').style.display='block'">423</sup> A trend becomes visible over the decades, as the
                           number of novels carrying identity labels decreases continuously. A third
                           point that can be drawn from the top frequent explicit labels is which
                           subgenres are more important in the corpus than in the bibliography. These
                           are the novels of customs, realist, and naturalistic novels linked to the
                           labels “novela realista” and “estudio” and also Cuban novels.</p>
                        
                        <p id="p527"><span class="paracount w3-blue-grey w3-margin-right"><a href="#p527">527</a></span>If implicit signals are included in the evaluation, the range
                           of subgenres broadens because some subgenres are never marked explicitly.
                           This also means that the assignment of subgenre labels gets more
                           interpretive. For 511 works (62&nbsp;%) in the bibliography and 207 works (81&nbsp;%)
                           in the corpus, implicit signals were found.<sup id="ftn424" class="w3-btn w3-theme-l3 w3-circle" onclick="document.getElementById('ftn424-modal').style.display='block'">424</sup> If this is added to the
                           explicit information, subgenre signals were recognized for 738 novels (89&nbsp;%)
                           in the bibliography and 254 novels (99&nbsp;%) in the corpus. In the following,
                           the top 20 subgenre labels for Bib-ACMé and Conha19 are analzyed, taking
                           explicit and implicit signals into account together.<sup id="ftn425" class="w3-btn w3-theme-l3 w3-circle" onclick="document.getElementById('ftn425-modal').style.display='block'">425</sup></p>

                           related to the themes of the novels and to literary currents enter the top
                           positions: in the bibliography, rank 2 is still occupied by the “novela
                           histórica” followed by the primarily thematic labels “novela sentimental”
                           (rank 3), “novela social” (rank 6), “novela de costumbres” (rank 7), “novela
                           política” (rank 14), “novela criminal” (rank 17), and the “novela de la
                           ciudad” (rank 20). Labels relating to literary currents are “novela
                           romántica” (rank 4), “novela naturalista” (rank 12), and “novela realista”
                           (rank 15). This shift could be expected because the assessment of implicit
                           signals requires an interpretation frame, and subgenres focusing on theme
                           and literary currents are the dominant perspectives in literary
                           histories.</p>
                        
                        <p id="p529"><span class="paracount w3-blue-grey w3-margin-right"><a href="#p529">529</a></span>Comparing the top 20 signals of Bib-ACMé to Conha19, again,
                           some subgenres gain more weight in the corpus: the “novela sentimental”
                           moves from rank 3 to 2, the “novela de costumbres” from rank 7 to 4, the
                           “novela gauchesca” enters the top list on rank 20, the “novela naturalista”
                           from rank 12 to 8, and the “novela realista” from rank 15 to rank 10. The
                           “novela romántica”, on the other hand, gets less important and moves from
                           rank 4 to 6, the “novela histórica” switches from rank 2 to rank 3, and the
                           “novela de la ciudad” is not part of the top list anymore.</p>
                        
                        <p id="p530"><span class="paracount w3-blue-grey w3-margin-right"><a href="#p530">530</a></span>When only statements made by literary historians are
                           evaluated, the picture changes even more. Literary-historical assignments
                           were recorded for 433 works (52&nbsp;%) in the bibliography and 224 works (88&nbsp;%)
                           in the corpus. That the proportion of works with literary-historical labels
                           is much higher in the corpus is certainly because the corpus contains more
                           works that are better known and researched. There are 34 different
                           literary-historical labels in the bibliography and 32 different ones in the
                           corpus. As with the explicit paratextual signals, also here, the labels were

                           of a similar kind but in part differently ordered. The “novela romántica” is
                           also most important in the corpus. Labels with more weight than in the
                           overall bibliography are “novela social”, “novela de costumbres”, “novela
                           naturalista”, and “novela abolicionista”, for instance, and labels that are
                           less relevant in the corpus are, for example, “novela histórica”, “novela

                           ranks illustrate where there have been shifts in the composition by subgenre
                           due to the selection of works for the corpus. Some were made on purpose, for
                           example, the inclusion of more novels of customs as a counterbalance to the
                           great majority of historical novels or a preferred inclusion of Cuban novels
                           to strengthen the smallest country group. Others depend on the availability
                           of the novels. Many crime and gaucho novels can be classified as
                           low-prestige novels and are not yet readily available in digital format.</p>

                           signals, and literary-historical subgenre assignments underline that the
                           views on what a subgenre of the novel is differ considerably, depending on
                           the practice and the purpose of the labeling. There are only some
                           intersections. The labels assigned to the historical editions probably
                           served a number of functions: 
                           <ul>
                              
                              <li>to clearly mark a novel as an instance of a known and popular
                                 subgenre of the time (e.g., “novela histórica”, “novela de
                                 costumbres”),</li>
                              
                              <li>to associate a novel with a certain literary current or school by
                                 using terms that were&nbsp;loaded with such semantics (e.g., “estudio”,
                                 “cuadros”),</li>
                              
                              <li>to signal that the language and content of a novel are
                                 autochthonous (e.g., “novela original”, “novela americana”),</li>
                              
                              <li>or to give the novel other attributes inscribing it in the general
                                 history of genres, playing with terms, or attracting attention towards
                                 its particular way of (re)presentation (e.g., “leyenda”, “episodios”,
                                 “memorias”, “drama”), among other possibilities.</li>
                              </ul> Literary-historical assignments of subgenre labels, on the other
                           hand, usually have the primary function of classifying the works in question
                           according to established critical schemes. They are much more uniform and
                           concentrate on aspects of style and content that allow for connecting the
                           novels with subgenres 
                           <ul>
                              
                              <li>that are rich in tradition (e.g., “novela histórica”, “novela
                                 sentimental”, “novela de aventuras”),</li>
                              
                              <li>that are associated with certain literary periods and currents
                                 (“novela romántica”, “novela realista”, etc.),</li>
                              
                              <li>or that are of special critical interest regarding the novelistic
                                 production of a certain cultural-historical space (“novela gauchesca”,
                                 “novela indigenista”, “novela abolicionista”).</li>
                              </ul> Only in part do these two practices of labeling individual novels
                           with (sub)generic terms overlap. The top lists of subgenre labels show that
                           the labeling is more systematic in the literary-historical approach: there
                           are not just a few thematically oriented labels but a whole range of them,
                           and not just one or two labels relating to literary currents but labels for
                           all the currents that have been recognized as relevant in the nineteenth
                           century. The historical practice, on the other hand, is much more selective.
                           “Novelas históricas” and “novelas de costumbres” were commonly explicitly
                           named, but “novelas sentimentales”, for example, only exceptionally. In
                           addition, there is historical evidence in the bibliography for the labels
                           “novela realista” and “novela naturalista”, but not for the “novela
                           romántica”. This does not prove that there was no awareness of the latter,
                           but apparently, some types of novels were more part of a general, given
                           generic pool than others.</p>

                           degree than the historical labels. This becomes very clear when the same
                           novel is labeled with several terms at the same time. The works of the
                           Mexican writer Victoriano Salado Álvarez, for example, have been classified

                           subgenres that aims to select and compare subsets of novels from a corpus.
                           Therefore, the explicit, implicit, and literary-historical labels have been
                           sorted according to a system of discursive categories, as explained above in
                           <a href="ch3.html#ch3.2.3">chapter 3.2.3</a>, resulting in
                           several sets of labels that belong to different discursive levels but whose
                           comparison is more meaningful on each level. It has to be reminded, though,
                           that this system is artificial. In what follows, overviews of the different
                           sets of subgenre labels based on the discursive model of subgenre terms are
                           given for the bibliography and the corpus. First, summaries of how many

                           there in the whole bibliography? In total, there are 124 different terms.
                           Most of them belong to the thematic group (39&nbsp;%), followed by the mode the
                           novel is represented in linguistically or narratively (36&nbsp;%), the
                           cultural-geographical and linguistic identity of the novel (20&nbsp;%), the
                           medium that the novel uses (11&nbsp;%), the intention of the author or narrator
                           (10&nbsp;%), the relationship between the novel and reality (8&nbsp;%), the literary
                           current of the novel (5&nbsp;%), and the attitude the author or narrator has
                           towards what is represented in the novel (4&nbsp;%). The diversity of thematic
                           labels is not surprising, and that there is only a small set of labels
                           related to literary currents is expectable as the number of different
                           currents is limited. The broad range of labels referring to the mode of
                           representation and also to the identity was not expected, though, as these
                           aspects are usually not focused on in studies of subgenres of the

                           labels. This means that the diversity of explicit labels doubles the
                           diversity of literary-historical labels in the corpus and is three times
                           higher in the bibliography. Regarding the overall number of labels, 1,669
                           explicit labels and 1,120 literary-historical labels were assigned to the
                           works in the bibliography, and 564 explicit and 686 literary-historical
                           labels were assigned to the works in the corpus. So on average, a
                           literary-historical label is assigned more often than an explicit
                           label.<sup id="ftn432" class="w3-btn w3-theme-l3 w3-circle" onclick="document.getElementById('ftn432-modal').style.display='block'">432</sup> The following <a href="#tab23">table 23</a>&nbsp;summarizes the importance of the different

                           literary-historical labels), thematic labels are also generally important.
                           Regarding the overall number of labels, the mode of reality also has some
                           importance for both explicit and literary-historical labels. The relevance
                           of the other levels depends more on the provenance of the labels. For
                           explicit labels, the mode of representation and identity are prominent, and
                           for literary-historical labels, in particular, the literary currents. The
                           ranks do not change for the corpus, apart from minor shifts in the last
                           positions.<sup id="ftn434" class="w3-btn w3-theme-l3 w3-circle" onclick="document.getElementById('ftn434-modal').style.display='block'">434</sup> Regarding the importance of the
                           linguistic and cultural-geographical identity of the novels, it has to be
                           said that this aspect is, of course, also a topic in the critical discourse
                           about the novels, but in a different way than in the historical practice of
                           labeling the works. For literary-historical studies, usually, the linguistic
                           and cultural-geographical frame is set from the beginning on. Either it
                           concentrates on one national space, e.g., “the Mexican novel”, or on Spanish
                           America or Latin America as a whole and then differentiating the novels by
                           country. However, usually, no difference is made between one work or the
                           other and the attribution to the cultural-geographical space is made based
                           on general extra-textual parameters. On the other hand, in literary
                           histories, works are also reviewed in terms of how their content reflects
                           local or foreign realities, but usually in more general terms and without
                           explicitly categorizing novels in that way. Furthermore, the question of the
                           own and the foreign is discussed more in aesthetic categories.<sup id="ftn435" class="w3-btn w3-theme-l3 w3-circle" onclick="document.getElementById('ftn435-modal').style.display='block'">435</sup></p>

                              overview of what kind of subgenre labels are relevant in Bib-ACMé and
                              Conha19. Proceeding to the individual levels and the actual labels, it
                              becomes clearer what these subgenres are and which ones dominate from a
                              quantitative point of view. The different levels are presented here in
                              the order of their relevance for analyses of the novels in the corpus
                              from a quantitative point of view. Starting with the thematic labels, of
                              all the works in the bibliography, 695 (84&nbsp;%) have such a label. In the
                              corpus, all the works have been assigned at least one thematic label.
                              There are 48 different thematic labels in the bibliography, of which 18
                              are assigned to at least 10 works.<sup id="ftn436" class="w3-btn w3-theme-l3 w3-circle" onclick="document.getElementById('ftn436-modal').style.display='block'">436</sup> In the bibliography and in the corpus, as well, four
                              thematic subgenres are predominant: the sentimental novel, the historical
                              novel, the social novel, and the novel of customs. Especially in the
                              corpus, also the political novel is significant. Comparing bibliography
                              and corpus, the order and ratio of the top thematic subgenres are
                              different. In Conha19, the social novel and the novel of customs are
                              relatively more important, and the sentimental and historical novels are
                              less relevant. However, the absolute amount of these four subgenres is
                              more balanced in the corpus than in the bibliography.</p>

                              historical novel and the novel of customs are the most important
                              historically explicit subgenres, followed by the “leyenda” and the
                              “novela policial”. Especially the sentimental novel is implicitly
                              signaled. All four top subgenres play an important role as
                              literary-historical subgenres. Although this list of thematic labels is
                              already the result of a process of systematization, two kinds of
                              one-to-many relationships persist: the same label can also play a role on
                              other discursive levels (the “novela histórica”, “leyenda”, and “novela
                              contemporánea”, for example, are also among the labels referring to the
                              relationship between the novel and reality) and each novel cannot just
                              carry one, but several thematic labels. The latter is very often the
                              case.<sup id="ftn438" class="w3-btn w3-theme-l3 w3-circle" onclick="document.getElementById('ftn438-modal').style.display='block'">438</sup> In the
                              bibliography, 16&nbsp;% of the novels do not have any thematic label, 45&nbsp;%
                              have just one, 23&nbsp;% have two, 11&nbsp;% have three, and 5&nbsp;% have more than
                              three thematic labels. In the corpus, all the novels have thematic
                              labels: 38&nbsp;% have just one, 33&nbsp;% have two, 18&nbsp;% have three, and 11&nbsp;% have
                              more than three different thematic labels. The difference between the
                              bibliography and the corpus shows that the more is known about the works,
                              the more differentiated (and less clear) their categorization is in terms
                              of subgenres. Besides the one-to-many relationships, i.e., one work to
                              many thematic subgenre labels, there are also relationships of overlap or
                              inclusion among the different thematic labels. For example, the “novela
                              abolicionista” can be considered a special type of social novel, and the
                              “leyenda” is associated with historical content just as the “novela
                              histórica”.<sup id="ftn439" class="w3-btn w3-theme-l3 w3-circle" onclick="document.getElementById('ftn439-modal').style.display='block'">439</sup> Relationships of this kind also become

                              both in the bibliography and the corpus is “novela de costumbres” and
                              “novela social”. Most top combinations are very frequent in both Bib-ACMé
                              and Conha19, even if the ranks are not exactly the same. Combinations
                              that are only in the top ten of the bibliography are highlighted in blue,
                              and the ones that are only in the top list of the corpus are highlighted
                              in orange. As can be seen, combinations including the “leyenda” and
                              “novela indigenista” have more weight in the bibliography and
                              combinations including the “novela política” and the “novela

                              the “novela sentimental” with other types are the most frequent ones that
                              are not characterized by semantic overlap.</p>

                              consequences for a digital quantitative analysis that aims to analyze
                              novels in terms of subgenre categories. First, for very small groups, it
                              is hardly possible to achieve general results as they will be influenced
                              very much by the particular characteristics of the few individual works
                              that form the group. Furthermore, groups of very different sizes cause
                              problems when evaluating the performance of a categorization task. In the
                              case of a large majority, good results could simply be achieved by always
                              choosing that group. To avoid that, the groups to compare would have to
                              be balanced down to the smallest size by undersampling. Another strategy
                              is oversampling, where instances of the smallest group are duplicated,
                              which again can cause problems of overfitting and a lack of
                              generalizability.<sup id="ftn441" class="w3-btn w3-theme-l3 w3-circle" onclick="document.getElementById('ftn441-modal').style.display='block'">441</sup> This study will concentrate
                              on the largest groups of novels that are represented in the corpus to
                              avoid these problems as far as possible. In the case of thematic
                              subgenres, these are sentimental, historical, and social novels, novels
                              of customs, and political novels.</p>

                              decide on primary labels. For thematic labels and those relating to
                              literary currents, this was done by choosing the label 
                              <ul>
                                 
                                 <li>that was most prominent in the signals,</li>
                                 
                                 <li>that was most often assigned by literary historians or mentioned
                                    by them as the primary label,</li>
                                 
                                 <li>that corresponded to the same level of generality as the major
                                    groups,</li>
                                 
                                 <li>or that was most informative.</li>
                                 </ul> However, it was not possible to define only one criterion because
                              the sources of the labels, the kind of different labels, and the amount
                              of available information about the subgenres differ from case to case. By
                              choosing a primary label, it becomes possible to separate groups of
                              novels on a specific discursive level. It has to be reminded, though,
                              that this is another step of interpretation and simplification. In the
                              following, the results of choosing a primary subgenre for the thematic
                              labels are discussed.</p>

                              of the top thematic subgenres both in the bibliography and in the
                              corpus.<sup id="ftn442" class="w3-btn w3-theme-l3 w3-circle" onclick="document.getElementById('ftn442-modal').style.display='block'">442</sup> In Bib-ACMé,
                              the historical novel becomes more important than the sentimental novel,
                              and in Conha19, also the historical novel rises from the fourth to the
                              top position and changes place with the social novel. This shows that
                              both the sentimental and the social are often secondary thematic aspects
                              in the novels, but at the same time, they can also be primary concerns.
                              The primary labels can be used as target values in a standard
                              categorization task, keeping in mind that part of the works has secondary
                              labels when evaluating the results. Another possibility to handle
                              multiple assignments of subgenre labels on the same discursive level is
                              to include them all in the analysis. For a categorization task, this
                              would mean allowing multiple target values, as, for example, in a
                              multi-label classification.<sup id="ftn443" class="w3-btn w3-theme-l3 w3-circle" onclick="document.getElementById('ftn443-modal').style.display='block'">443</sup> In both cases,
                              one has to be aware of using subgenre labels that stem from multiple
                              sources and that have been assigned to the works by people with different
                              perspectives on them and different interests in them. The goal of such a
                              categorization can only be to examine to what extent the collective
                              labelings actually reflect characteristics of the texts, and to find out
                              to which traits of the texts they correspond. If literary-historical
                              sources are included, these already introduce an element of
                              systematization, so the digital text analysis then aims to analyze in
                              what way this system matches the one found based on a computational
                              treatment of the texts. The collectivity of labelings also applies to
                              explicit historical labels when the whole set of novels is concerned, and
                              to a lesser degree also per work, for example, when there is a label
                              mentioned on a title page and the same or another one in a foreword or
                              introduction written by someone who is not the author or editor of the
                              work. Usually, though, historical labels are not multiple because they
                              stand for a will to mark a novel as a representative of a certain
                              subgenre and do not aim to describe the text systematically in all its
                              aspects. Still, cases of multiple assignments also exist for historical
                              labels, especially on different discursive levels, but also on the same
                              ones. An extreme case is the novel “Los bandidos de Río Frío” (1892, MX)
                              by Manuel Payno which has the subtitle “Novela naturalista, humorística,
                              de costumbres, de crímenes y de horrores”, including two thematic labels
                              (“novela de costumbres”, “novela de crímenes”), two labels of intention
                              (“novela humorística”, “novela de horrores”) and one label indicating the
                              literary current (“novela naturalista”). Another combination that occurs
                              three times in the bibliography is that of “novela histórica” and “novela
                              de costumbres”.<sup id="ftn444" class="w3-btn w3-theme-l3 w3-circle" onclick="document.getElementById('ftn444-modal').style.display='block'">444</sup></p>

                              current is, above all, a critical task, so there are fewer sources than
                              for thematic labels, as the latter draw from explicit and implicit

                              different labels of literary currents. The ranks of the subgenre labels
                              related to literary currents are the same for the bibliography and the
                              corpus. Of the works that are associated with a literary current, most
                              were labeled as “novela romántica”, followed by “novela realista” and
                              “novela naturalista”. Three other subgenre labels related to literary
                              currents occur but do only play a minor role from a quantitative point of
                              view: “novela modernista”, “novela verista”, and “novela clasicista”.
                              Comparing Bib-ACMé and Conha19, realist and naturalistic novels are
                              relatively more important in the corpus than in the bibliography.
                              Regarding the sources for the labels related to literary currents,
                              literary-historical sources and implicit signals play the most important
                              role.<sup id="ftn446" class="w3-btn w3-theme-l3 w3-circle" onclick="document.getElementById('ftn446-modal').style.display='block'">446</sup></p>

                              with literary currents. All the novels that were labeled as naturalistic
                              novels were also marked as realist novels here because Naturalism is
                              considered a current that evolved from and is closely related to Realism,
                              and there are literary-historical sources for Spanish-American novels
                              that do not differentiate clearly between the two. On the other hand,
                              realist novels are not automatically also considered naturalistic novels,
                              so the label “novela naturalista” is a more specific marker. Furthermore,
                              there are eight novels in the bibliography, seven of which are also in
                              the corpus, with the labels “novela romántica” and “novela realista” in

                              because the influences of several different literary currents in the
                              works are often mentioned. Very differentiated descriptions are not fully
                              represented in the subgenre labels. Instead, the main labels that were
                              mentioned in the literary-historical sources were collected, for
                              instance, the heading of a chapter in which a novel is included or the
                              dominant literary current to which it is attributed in the source.<sup id="ftn449" class="w3-btn w3-theme-l3 w3-circle" onclick="document.getElementById('ftn449-modal').style.display='block'">449</sup> Multiple labels were only assigned where different

                              of when the different currents dominated and replaced each other. To this
                              end, the distribution of works in the bibliography over the years per
                              current is analyzed here, considering the publication date of the first

                              First, it can be confirmed that different currents that followed each
                              other temporarily in Europe were in vogue simultaneously in Spanish
                              America. For instance, the majority of the naturalistic novels were
                              published at the same time as the realist novels, approximately between
                              1880 and 1900.<sup id="ftn452" class="w3-btn w3-theme-l3 w3-circle" onclick="document.getElementById('ftn452-modal').style.display='block'">452</sup>
                              Furthermore, the <em>novela modernista</em> came up approximately at

                              around 1890. That the Romantic novel was a phenomenon that persisted
                              during the whole century is also confirmed by evaluating the publication

                              decade in which the proportions of romantic novels versus novels of other
                              literary currents shifted. However, based on Bib-ACMé, this shift can be
                              dated more precisely here. Three-thirds of the romantic novels were
                              published up to 1886, and three-thirds of the realist and naturalistic
                              novels from 1888 and 1887 onwards, respectively. So instead of the year
                              1880 itself, 1887 is the year with a quantitative move from romantic to
                              post-romantic currents.</p>

                              labels are suitable for standard classification because the number of
                              different classes is manageable, and apart from the realist-naturalistic
                              relationship, multiple labels are the exception. At least the groups
                              romantic versus realist-naturalistic are both represented with many
                              members. One useful application would be to train a model with the novels
                              in the corpus that have labels related to literary currents and use the
                              model to also label the 55 works for which no such label was found.</p>

                              the mode of representation. In Bib-ACMé, 556 works (67&nbsp;%), and in Conha
                              19, 188 works (73&nbsp;%) have a label related to the representational mode.
                              Compared to the previously examined levels, in Bib-ACMé, these are fewer
                              works than those with thematic labels but more than with labels related
                              to literary currents. For Conha19, the proportion of works with a label
                              related to the mode of representation is comparable to those with a label
                              related to literary currents but less than the proportion of works with
                              thematic labels. In the bibliography, 45 different labels belong to this
                              level. Of these, 17 are assigned to at least five works.</p>

                              or “Páginas íntimas” (1895, MX) by Manuel Blanco. However, there are also
                              historical or political novels with labels referring to a medial aspect,
                              for instance, “Campaña y Guarnición. Escenas de la vida militar” (1892,

                              of the labels associated with medial aspects are almost exclusively

                              works), and “novela didáctica” (5 works). In the corpus, “estudio” is the
                              most frequent with five works, and the other labels only occur three
                              times or less. The “novela moralista” and the “novela didáctica” are
                              subgenres that are a topic in literary histories, but the other labels
                              all have explicit or implicit signals as their source. Roughly, the
                              different labels of this group can be classified into labels of
                              entertainment (“novela humorística”, “novela cómica”, “entretenimientos”,
                              “novela curiosa”, “juguete”, “comedia de carácter”, “novela de horrores”)
                              and instruction (“novela moralista”, “estudio”, “novela didáctica”,
                              “novela de propaganda”, “lecturas”, “novela enciclopédica”). Because this
                              last group of subgenre labels is small, it is not examined further in the

                              subgenre labels that was used here to organize the subgenres contained in
                              the bibliography and the corpus and which served to get an overview of
                              their quantitative distributions, it can be concluded that the model is
                              helpful in enhancing the comparability of subgenre labels. Generic labels
                              usually refer to certain semiotic or discursive levels of a literary
                              work, which can be quite different, for example, the spatial context
                              versus the syntactical realization of a work, and which cannot be
                              compared directly in a useful way.</p>
                           
                           <p id="p575"><span class="paracount w3-blue-grey w3-margin-right"><a href="#p575">575</a></span>The specific model was created based on the metadata
                              collected for Bib-ACMé and Conha19 and helped determine which discursive
                              levels are relevant from a quantitative point of view. Applying it to the
                              metadata and evaluating the resulting quantities clarifies which levels
                              have a certain weight, either regarding the variety of labels or the
                              number of labels assigned to the novels. The relevance of some levels was
                              expected because they are traditionally a focus of critical concern:
                              thematic labels and labels related to literary currents. Other levels –
                              the mode of representation, the mode of reality, and identity – resulted
                              in having a certain quantitative significance, as well. This highlights
                              perspectives on subgeneric terms that have not been discussed widely so
                              far and that are mainly derived from explicit historical subgenre
                              signals. It has to be analyzed if and to what extent the historical
                              practices of assigning such labels to the novels actually correspond to
                              textual patterns. In addition, some levels are dominated by individual
                              subgenre labels, which trigger the overall quantitative importance of the
                              respective level, for example, the general term “novela” on the level of
                              the representational mode or the “novela histórica” on the level of the
                              reality mode. All in all, it became clear that compared to the overall
                              variety of subgenre labels, relatively few of them are very
                              frequent.<sup id="ftn474" class="w3-btn w3-theme-l3 w3-circle" onclick="document.getElementById('ftn474-modal').style.display='block'">474</sup></p>

                              the different labels in the bibliography, are only assigned to up to 9
                              works. In Conha19, this is true for 73 labels, which is 81&nbsp;% of all the
                              different labels in the corpus. In the bibliography, only 13 labels are
                              assigned to 50 works or more.<sup id="ftn475" class="w3-btn w3-theme-l3 w3-circle" onclick="document.getElementById('ftn475-modal').style.display='block'">475</sup> Regarding the sources of labels,
                              there are 108 different explicitly signaled labels and 34 different
                              literary-historical labels. All these numbers are based on normalized
                              terms, so variances in spelling, formulation, and syntactic constructions
                              are not causing the broad range of subgenre labels. Following these
                              numbers, it can be assumed that in the historical practice of explicitly
                              labeling novels, in particular, creativity and the emphasis on
                              individuality are important factors besides the wish to mark a work as
                              belonging to some established or widely practiced subgenre. In
                              literary-historical approaches, on the other hand, subgenres are studied
                              independently of their quantitative weight in the whole production of
                              novels. In comparison, a digital quantitative approach to the subgenres
                              sets different focuses of analysis, or rather, it is only usefully
                              applicable to a subset of the whole range of generic signals and
                              classifications.</p>

                              applying the discursive model. Actually, the semiotic and discursive
                              models of generic terms are above all descriptive models and do not claim
                              to tackle these issues:

                                    meaning on several discursive levels (the term “novela histórica”,
                                    for instance, refers to certain themes but also to the relationship
                                    between the text and reality)</li>

                                    can have a different, narrower or broader, semantic scope, which
                                    can lead to relationships of inclusion or overlap (the “novela
                                    abolicionista”, for instance, can be understood as a special kind
                                    of “novela social”, while both are terms on the thematic level); in
                                    addition, no clear line is drawn between generic and subgeneric
                                    terms (the term “novela”, for example, is more general than “novela
                                    epistolar”, but both refer to the mode of representation)</li>

                                    is not controlled (none, just one, or several generic terms of
                                    different levels or of the same level can be associated with one
                                    work) so that the generic information is not necessarily complete
                                    on all the levels or unique on individual levels (for instance, the
                                    literary current of a part of the novels was not determined; on the
                                    other hand many novels had multiple labels, for example, on the
                                    thematic level)</li>

                                    they are defined. As for general language terms, also the semantics
                                    of generic terms is determined by their use, synchronously and
                                    diachronically, by numerous different speakers, writers, and
                                    critics, at least if the terms are not restricted to selected
                                    scholarly defined ones; on the other side, assigning terms to the

                                    certain semantic aspects so that another level of uncertainty is

                              historically bound, and neither exhaustive nor unique, and when these
                              tasks are based on how the labels are ordered in the discursive model of
                              subgenre terms, this constitutes a simplifying choice of perspective on a
                              more complex system of generic relationships. To conclude this section of
                              metadata analysis of the subgenres, only the constellations of labels
                              selected for further analysis are presented in more detail, i.e.,
                              differentiating the overviews also by country, time period, and related
                              to corpus-specific metadata and characteristics of the texts. This is
                              done in the following subchapters.</p>

                           concentrating on the three most frequent subgenres (<em>novela

                              only the top primary thematic subgenres are analyzed in detail,
                              summarizing the remaining ones as “other”. Primary thematic subgenres are
                              considered “top” if they cover at least 5&nbsp;% of the works in the corpus.
                              Although the proportion may be higher in the bibliography, the coverage
                              in the corpus is decisive because, in the end, only the full text of the
                              novels in the corpus is analyzed. First, the general proportions of
                              novels having a certain primary thematic subgenre label in the
                              bibliography and the corpus are assessed.<sup id="ftn476" class="w3-btn w3-theme-l3 w3-circle" onclick="document.getElementById('ftn476-modal').style.display='block'">476</sup> This
                              general overview serves as a reference point for the overviews
                              differentiating by further parameters such as country, time period, etc.
                              In Bib-ACMé, 16&nbsp;% of the works do not have any thematic subgenre label,
                              whereas in Conha19, all the works were labeled thematically. In both
                              resources, historical novels are most frequent, followed by sentimental
                              novels. In the corpus, novels of customs, social, and political novels
                              have more weight than in the bibliography.</p>

                              three countries Mexico, Argentina, and Cuba.<sup id="ftn477" class="w3-btn w3-theme-l3 w3-circle" onclick="document.getElementById('ftn477-modal').style.display='block'">477</sup> As for historical novels, in the
                              bibliography, they are overrepresented in the Mexican works (38&nbsp;%). In
                              the Argentine novels, and even more in the Cuban ones, historical novels
                              are underrepresented (19&nbsp;% and 12&nbsp;%, respectively). In the corpus, the
                              distribution of historical novels is more balanced by country. However,
                              even there, the Mexican works have a greater proportion of historical
                              novels (32&nbsp;%) than the Argentine (23&nbsp;%) and Cuban ones (20&nbsp;%).
                              Sentimental novels are slightly underrepresented in the Mexican and
                              Argentine works contained in Bib-ACMé (19&nbsp;%, respectively), and clearly
                              overrepresented in the Cuban works (33&nbsp;%). Also for this subgenre, the
                              distribution is a bit more balanced in the corpus. The novels of customs
                              are proportionally overrepresented in the Cuban works in the bibliography
                              and also in the corpus. Social novels are above average in Argentine
                              novels and below average in novels of other countries, both in Bib-ACMé
                              and Conha19. Finally, in the bibliography, political novels are a bit
                              overrepresented in the Argentine works and underrepresented in the
                              Mexican and Cuban works, slightly in the first and more in the latter
                              case. In the corpus, in contrast, there are relatively more political
                              novels from Mexico, while the Argentine novels correspond to the average,
                              and for Cuba, there are no political novels at all. So regarding the
                              distribution of primary thematic subgenres by country, the differences
                              between Argentine, Cuban, and Mexican works that are visible in the
                              bibliography are, for the most part, also reflected in the corpus, where
                              they are balanced out a bit. In summary, there are more historical novels
                              from Mexico, more sentimental novels and <em>novelas de
                                 costumbres</em> from Cuba, and more social novels from Argentina. In
                              the following, the distribution of primary thematic subgenres is given
                              per decade, for Bib-ACMé and Conha19, respectively.<sup id="ftn478" class="w3-btn w3-theme-l3 w3-circle" onclick="document.getElementById('ftn478-modal').style.display='block'">478</sup></p>

                              is that all of the top primary thematic subgenres occur in almost all of
                              the decades. The political novel is missing in the 1830s and 1840s, and
                              the social novel in the 1840s. In the corpus, there are some more decades
                              without works of individual subgenres, especially the first and last
                              decades. There is only one novel of customs from the 1830s and one novel
                              of a different subgenre. There are only three novels from the 1910: one
                              political novel, one social novel, and one historical novel. In the more
                              central decades, no political novel is included in the 1840s, 1860s, and
                              1870s. No social novel is present in the 1840s and 1870s. In contrast,
                              historical novels, sentimental novels, and novels of customs are
                              represented in all the central decades of the corpus.</p>
                           
                           <p id="p583"><span class="paracount w3-blue-grey w3-margin-right"><a href="#p583">583</a></span>Regarding the relative amount of different subgenres over
                              the decades, in the bibliography, the proportion of historical and
                              sentimental novels is higher up to the 1860s. After that, especially the
                              social novel gets more significant. When compared to the bibliography, in
                              the corpus, especially the 1860s stand out as a decade with an
                              over-proportional number of historical novels and the 1890s with an
                              above-average number of social novels. The change of proportions of
                              primary thematic subgenres over time becomes clearer if the two periods
                              before 1880 and in or after the year 1880 are compared.<sup id="ftn479" class="w3-btn w3-theme-l3 w3-circle" onclick="document.getElementById('ftn479-modal').style.display='block'">479</sup></p>

                              novels is lower after 1880 (17&nbsp;% instead of 28&nbsp;% before), and the number
                              of social novels higher (14&nbsp;% instead of 6&nbsp;%). The political novel, which
                              is in general not very frequent, also raises from 1&nbsp;% of the works before
                              1880 to 4&nbsp;% after that year. Furthermore, the share of works without any
                              thematic subgenre label is considerably higher in the later period (19&nbsp;%
                              instead of 10&nbsp;%). On the other hand, the differences between the
                              proportion of historical novels and novels of customs are not very big
                              between the two periods (4&nbsp;% in the case of the historical novels and 3&nbsp;%
                              for the novels of customs). In general, and regardless of the shifts of
                              proportions, the absolute number of novels of all the primary thematic
                              subgenres is higher in the second period than in the first one.</p>

                              novels and novels with other subgenres drops for the period after 1880.
                              On the other hand, the relative increase of social and political novels
                              is even higher than in the bibliography. There is almost no change in the
                              proportion of novels of customs between the two periods, but the relative
                              importance of the historical novel drops more in the corpus than in the
                              bibliography. It can be assumed that the change of proportions of the
                              various thematic subgenres over time reflects the preferences of the
                              different literary currents, which overlap and succeed each other during
                              the nineteenth century. The romantic current is apparently more closely
                              related to semantic and historical themes, and the realist and
                              naturalistic novels to social and political topics. However, the
                              historical novel persists as an important subgenre throughout the whole
                              century, and also the novel of customs remains relevant. It is striking
                              that the only two thematic subgenres that are frequently explicitly named
                              in the novels’ subtitles, the <em>novela histórica</em> and the
                              <em>novela de costumbres</em>, are the ones that are less subject
                              to change in terms of relative quantities over time, which means that
                              they are less bound to the dominant literary currents than the other
                              thematic subgenres.</p>

                              subgenres is analyzed in relationship to corpus-specific metadata and
                              text characteristics, namely the prestige of the texts, the narrative
                              perspective, the continent and time period of the setting, and text
                              length. The first of the corpus-specific aspects to be analyzed is the
                              prestige of the texts.<sup id="ftn480" class="w3-btn w3-theme-l3 w3-circle" onclick="document.getElementById('ftn480-modal').style.display='block'">480</sup> Historical novels are equally
                              present both in high- and low-prestige novels. The sentimental novels, in
                              contrast, are underrepresented among the high-restige novels and
                              overrepresented in the low-prestige ones. Interestingly, of the novels of
                              customs, relatively more are classified as high- than as low-prestige.
                              The social novels are slightly overrepresented in the high-prestige group
                              and the political novels in the low-prestige one. Especially in the
                              latter case, the difference is not considered significant because of the
                              comparatively low number of political novels in the corpus. It can be
                              concluded that one of the primary thematic subgenres, the sentimental
                              novel, is clearly marked as having a low-prestige branch, but none of the
                              other subgenres sticks out as a particular high-prestige subgenre.</p>

                              of historical novels are written in the third person. Social novels also
                              primarily have a third-person narrator. The first-person narrator is most
                              frequent in sentimental novels but also overrepresented in the group of
                              political novels. In the novels of customs, both narrative perspectives
                              are almost equally in use. It is noticeable that 20&nbsp;% of the novels with
                              a first person narrator have a primary thematic subgenre that is part of
                              the “other” group, so apparently, this perspective is favored in some of
                              the subgenres that are less frequent.<sup id="ftn481" class="w3-btn w3-theme-l3 w3-circle" onclick="document.getElementById('ftn481-modal').style.display='block'">481</sup></p>

                              novels set in Europe (46&nbsp;%) are sentimental novels. <em>Novelas de

                              4&nbsp;%. The political novels are exclusively set in America. There are

                              American setting is more prominent. Only the proportion of historical
                              novels is almost the same for the American and the European setting. A
                              hypothesis that follows from this is that European models of sentimental
                              novels were more often just copied and that models of other subgenres
                              were more often adapted and appropriated to reflect the local
                              circumstances, or even that they developed more into independent
                              varieties of the subgenres.</p>

                              Obviously, most of the novels set in the past are historical novels
                              (85&nbsp;%), and there are no primarily sentimental or political novels in

                              information is available from literary-historical accounts of the novels
                              and not from explicit historical subgenre labels. As many of the novels

                              literary-historical work, this information is missing. In the corpus, the

                              (79&nbsp;% or 201 novels), which again shows that the corpus represents works
                              that are better known and more canonized than the works in the whole

                              literary currents are not taken into account here. Examples are novels
                              that are borderline cases or mixtures of romantic and realist novels but
                              also all naturalistic novels that can as well be understood as realist

                              literary current are the romantic novels, with 32&nbsp;% or 263 novels. This
                              is also the case in the corpus, where the romantic novels have a share of
                              45&nbsp;% or 116 novels. In the bibliography, the amount of realist and
                              naturalistic novels is equal (8&nbsp;% or 66 novels each), while in the
                              corpus, there are a bit more naturalistic works (18&nbsp;% or 45 novels) than
                              realist ones (14&nbsp;% or 35 novels). Other literary currents only have a
                              minor quantitative importance in both the bibliography and the corpus.
                              Compared to the bibliography, the relationship between romantic novels on
                              the one side and realist and naturalistic novels on the other is more
                              balanced in the corpus. However, it is difficult to say if this turns the
                              corpus further away from the population of novels or not because the
                              literary current is unknown for so many novels in the bibliography.</p>

                              literary current is unknown is similar in the three countries, but in the
                              corpus, it is highest for the Cuban novels and lowest for the Mexican
                              ones, with the Argentine novels in-between. The higher number of unknown
                              cases for Cuba reflects that apart from a few very well-known works,
                              novels from that country appear to be less studied. Regarding the
                              distribution of the different literary currents by country, in the
                              bibliography, approximately one-third of the novels are romantic ones,
                              also by country. In Conha19, however, the proportion of romantic novels
                              is bigger for Mexico (55&nbsp;%) than for the other two countries. Most
                              realist novels come from Mexico, in the bibliography, and also in the
                              corpus. The naturalistic novels have the most weight in Argentina, both

                              the romantic novel is a phenomenon that persisted throughout the whole
                              nineteenth century. It was the dominant current up to the 1870s and only
                              gradually gave way to the other currents in the following decades. The
                              first realist and naturalistic works are found in the 1860s and 1870s,
                              but it was from the 1880s onwards that these two currents gained more
                              weight. If one compares the bibliography and the corpus, the proportions
                              are similar in both, only that there are relatively more realist and
                              naturalistic novels in the corpus. If only the relationship between
                              realist and naturalistic novels is examined, the latter are a bit
                              overrepresented in the corpus in the 1890s and 1900s. Considering the
                              period before and after 1880,<sup id="ftn492" class="w3-btn w3-theme-l3 w3-circle" onclick="document.getElementById('ftn492-modal').style.display='block'">492</sup> the
                              dominance of the romantic novel in the early period again stands out,
                              both in Bib-ACMé and Conha19. Moreover, even after 1880, the number of
                              romantic novels is higher (in the bibliography) or comparable (in the
                              corpus) to the amount of either realist or naturalistic works. Concerning
                              the number of works for which the literary current is unknown, it is very
                              high in the bibliography for the period after 1880, amounting to 59&nbsp;% of
                              all the novels. In the corpus, the proportion of works with unknown
                              currents is more balanced before and after 1880. As was seen before in
                              <a href="ch4.html#ch4.1.3.1">chapter 4.1.3.1,</a> where
                              the general number of works was assessed independently of the subgenres,
                              the number of works doubled from the 1870s to the 1880s. For the 1880s
                              and 1890s, the corpus contains approximately 30&nbsp;% of the novels that are
                              registered in the whole bibliography, but for the 1900s, only 20&nbsp;%. So
                              the high proportion of novels after 1880 in Bib-ACMé for which the
                              literary current is unknown shows that there is a mass of works that is
                              still mostly unexplored.</p>

                              metadata, starting with the proportions of high- and low-prestige novels

                              The most striking difference is the higher proportion of novels without a
                              literary current label in the low-prestige group, which is at 34&nbsp;%,
                              compared to 16&nbsp;% in the high-prestige group. This result is mainly due to
                              the way that the prestige of the novels was determined. Only works of
                              which at least one new edition was published between 1960 and 2020 were
                              considered high-prestige novels. The high proportion of novels without
                              known literary current in the low-prestige group is just another
                              perspective on them as a group of texts which has been largely forgotten
                              or has not been investigated in the last 60 years.<sup id="ftn494" class="w3-btn w3-theme-l3 w3-circle" onclick="document.getElementById('ftn494-modal').style.display='block'">494</sup></p>

                              third-person narrator is much more frequent in the corpus than the
                              first-person narrator: there are 44 novels (17&nbsp;%) with a first-person
                              narrator and 212 novels (83&nbsp;%) with third-person narrator. Interestingly,
                              the proportion of realist novels in the first-person narrator group is
                              considerably higher than in the third-person group. On the other hand,
                              naturalistic novels are overrepresented in the third-person group, and
                              also the romantic novels have a higher proportion in the latter one. In
                              his overview of the history of Latin-American literature, Dill introduces
                              the realist novel as follows: “Die Realität wurde nicht
                              costumbristisch-dokumentarisch kopiert, vielmehr mit literarischer
                              Inszenierung ein Ähnlichkeits- oder Realitätseffekt (<em>effet du

                              for the realist novel, but the overview of the novels in Conha19 suggests
                              that there is a subgroup of realist novels narrated in first person and
                              that the choice of this narrative perspective is a factor that
                              differentiates the realist from the naturalistic novel, where the third
                              person is proportionally more important. Checking which ones are the
                              realist novels with a first-person narrator reveals that they belong to
                              several different thematic subgenres: the sentimental novel, the
                              historical novel, the novel of customs, and the political novel, so one
                              specific type of thematic subgenre is not responsible for the number of
                              realist novels with first-person narrator. In addition, they were written
                              by different authors from the three countries.<sup id="ftn496" class="w3-btn w3-theme-l3 w3-circle" onclick="document.getElementById('ftn496-modal').style.display='block'">496</sup></p>

                              and European setting reveals that the romantic and also the realist
                              novels are preponderant for the American setting. Naturalistic novels
                              have a similar proportion in both groups, which means that the European
                              setting is relatively more important in them when compared to romantic
                              and realist novels. Apparently, the French origin of the naturalistic
                              current had an influence on the choice of the setting in some cases.
                              Nevertheless, the numbers of the continent of the setting must be
                              interpreted with caution because the great majority of the novels are set
                              in America (90&nbsp;%, 231 novels) and only a few in Europe (9&nbsp;%, 24

                              is a correlation with the countries of origin of the novels because
                              knowledge about the literary current is missing for many Cuban novels,
                              and novels from Cuba are also the ones that have a European setting more

                              high proportions in all three categories but is overrepresented in the
                              groups of novels with a setting in the past or recent past. The realist
                              novel primarily has a contemporary setting or one in the recent past, and
                              the naturalistic novel is, above all, set in the present. That the
                              romantic novel is inclined towards the past is in line with the fact that
                              the historical novel was a very popular thematic subgenre in that
                              current. However, the results also show that the romantic novel is a
                              multi-faceted phenomenon because all the different time periods of the
                              setting are covered by it to a significant extent. That the naturalistic
                              novel primarily has a contemporary setting confirms its role as the type
                              of novel that served to depict the process of social, economic, and
                              technological modernization going on in the Spanish-American countries in
                              the last decades of the nineteenth century. In terms of text style, the

                              of 66,000 tokens, the realist novels of 56,000, the naturalistic novels
                              of 51,000, novels with other literary currents of 62,000, and novels with
                              an unknown literary current of 42,0000 tokens.<sup id="ftn501" class="w3-btn w3-theme-l3 w3-circle" onclick="document.getElementById('ftn501-modal').style.display='block'">501</sup> Of most interest are
                              the differences between the romantic, realist, and naturalistic novels
                              because the group of novels with another literary current only consists
                              of 5 novels, and the “none” group is probably mixed. A test for
                              significance shows that the differences in length between the romantic,
                              realist, and naturalistic novels are not statistically significant,

                              differences in median text length are not significant, the group of
                              romantic novels has a bigger variance in length than the other two
                              currents, which are more similar regarding the variation of the novels’
                              length.<sup id="ftn503" class="w3-btn w3-theme-l3 w3-circle" onclick="document.getElementById('ftn503-modal').style.display='block'">503</sup>
                              That the length of romantic novels varies more is plausible because the
                              group of romantic novels in the corpus is bigger (116) than that of the
                              realist (35) or naturalistic (45) novels, but it can also be a sign of
                              the variability of romantic novels in themselves. Romantic novels can be
                              part of several distinct thematic subgenres, of which, for example,
                              historical novels can be very long and sentimental novels are usually
                              shorter. In addition, romantic novels spread over the whole nineteenth
                              century, whereas the realist and naturalistic novels were concentrated in
                              the decades 1880 to 1910. The general comparison of text length by decade
                              that was made in <a href="ch4.html#ch4.1.3.2">chapter
                                 4.1.3.2</a>&nbsp;above showed that the variability of text length was
                              lowest from the 1870s to the 1890s, and very long novels were the
                              exception in these decades. This suggests that the form of the novel in
                              terms of length was more stabilized in the last decades of the nineteenth
                              century. In Spanish America, romantic novels participated in all the
                              phases that the novel as a genre underwent in the nineteenth century, so
                              they were variable, whereas the realist and naturalistic novels were
                              anchored in a more precise literary-historical moment. That the variance
                              of the length of the three major currents is smallest for the
                              naturalistic novels can be interpreted as a sign for the relatively
                              uniform and defined form of the novels participating in that
                              subgenre.</p>

                              in the bibliography and the corpus will be briefly summarized and
                              evaluated here in overview. All in all, the proportions of works in the
                              corpus and the bibliography are very similar in most aspects. In the
                              corpus, some balancing can be noted, for example, concerning the
                              distribution of subgenres in general or by country. This means that the
                              corpus deviates from the distributions in the bibliography to mitigate
                              certain tendencies of imbalance and to achieve a dataset that is more
                              suited for an analysis of subgroups, even if it doesn’t represent the
                              proportions of the sampling frame closely. In addition, there are effects
                              that are due to the fact that the sources for the corpus are limited
                              because specific works are difficult to access in digital format. As a
                              whole, the corpus is not entirely balanced in all its aspects. Its
                              closeness to the distributions of subgroups in the bibliography is bigger
                              than their balance in terms of similar numbers in the corpus itself, for
                              example, by subgenre. The overviews of the subgenres selected for
                              analysis highlighted which metadata and also textual factors are
                              connected to the subgenres. They pointed out some interdependencies
                              (e.g., regarding narrative perspective or text length). Some influencing
                              factors only became visible from a single perspective, whereas others
                              manifested themselves repeatedly, such as the very long Mexican
                              historical novels, for instance.</p>

                              subgenres is of interest in itself, but it also provides useful
                              background knowledge for further textual analysis to be able to evaluate
                              possible biases in the results. Especially, differences between the works
                              of the three countries and also some chronological trends became visible.
                              When conducting analysis on the texts, it must be kept in mind that the
                              sampling frame and also the corpus are not entirely balanced datasets –
                              instead, there are many different factors influencing each other and some
                              asymmetries that are already characteristic of the underlying set of
                              novels. In the next chapter, the textual features used for text analysis
                              and the methods used to categorize the novels by subgenre are

                     general features derived from the most frequent words in the corpus, and the
                     second set consists of topic features created with topic modeling. In <a href="ch4.html#ch4.2.1">chapter 4.2.1</a>, it is explained what the
                     two main types of features are and how they were created. In the second part of
                     this chapter (<a href="ch4.html#ch4.2.2">4.2.2</a>), two different
                     methods are used to categorize the novels. First, statistical classification is
                     employed to classify the novels by subgenre. Three thematic subgenres
                     (<em>novela histórica</em>, <em>novela sentimental</em>, and
                     <em>novela de costumbres</em>) as well as three literary currents
                     (<em>novela romántica</em>, <em>novela realista</em>, <em>novela
                        naturalista</em>) were chosen for the analysis as the quantitatively most
                     relevant groups in the corpus. The classification methods that were used and the
                     results of the analysis are discussed in <a href="ch4.html#ch4.2.2.1">chapter 4.2.2.1</a>. A family resemblance analysis is&nbsp;realized in <a href="ch4.html#ch4.2.2.2">chapter 4.2.2.2</a>,&nbsp;and a proposal is
                     made for how the calculation of text similarities, network analyses, and community
                     detection can be used to that end. In the discussion of the results, selections
                     must be made as the amount of data that results from all the different analyses is
                     huge. The overall results are presented in every case, but the study of individual
                     subgenres and novels is only deepened in some cases.</p>

                        categorization tasks: general and semantic features. The general features
                        include different sets of tokens that are most frequent in the corpus (words,
                        word n-grams, and character n-grams). They are called “general” here because,
                        in their basic forms, these features are not filtered based on their linguistic

                        independently of specific grammatical or semantic properties that they might
                        have. The second feature group is called “semantic” because the feature sets
                        are built on lexical units and on tokens that convey meaning by the way they
                        occur together in the texts. In particular, the method of topic modeling is
                        used. The general features are presented in <a href="ch4.html#ch4.2.1.1">chapter 4.2.1.1</a>,&nbsp;and the semantic features are
                        outlined in <a href="ch4.html#ch4.2.1.2">chapter 4.2.1.2</a>.</p>

                        precisely because general features in the high-frequency spectrum are usually
                        only weakly semantically loaded, their interpretation can be more difficult
                        than for inherently semantic features.</p>

                        easier to inspect and that can be linked to expectations about known subgenres
                        of the novel, especially the thematic ones. A love theme, for example, is
                        assumed to occur in sentimental novels and also often in the ones belonging to
                        the romantic current. Historical novels are expected to include topics related
                        to political events or military confrontations, and novels of customs
                        descriptive topics that represent different spheres of life.<sup id="ftn505" class="w3-btn w3-theme-l3 w3-circle" onclick="document.getElementById('ftn505-modal').style.display='block'">505</sup> These examples
                        show that hypotheses about connections between specific subgenres of the novel
                        and different kinds of semantic characteristics of the texts are easily
                        formulated. The usage of semantic text features aims to make it possible to
                        check whether or not such assumptions hold when a large number of texts is
                        analyzed quantitatively, but it also enables the &nbsp;discovery of unexpected
                        correlations. Although semantic features are more closely related to the
                        contents of the texts than general token-based features, they can still be
                        considered stylistic features in a wide sense because how a theme is developed
                        in terms of topics in a text is a stylistic choice. This becomes clear when the
                        relationship between the general literary concept of theme and the specific
                        textual topic features is analyzed. In text-centered approaches, “theme” is
                        usually defined as a non-surface element characterizing the underlying
                        semantics of a narrative literary text and as an element that can be connected
                        to linguistic manifestations in the text.<sup id="ftn506" class="w3-btn w3-theme-l3 w3-circle" onclick="document.getElementById('ftn506-modal').style.display='block'">506</sup>
                        Topic features, in contrast, serve to directly measure characteristics of the
                        textual surface. These cues can subsequently be used to make inferences about
                        higher-order semantic structures of the texts, which can be interpreted in
                        terms of generic facets. So the literary theoretical concepts and the Natural
                        Language Processing terms are different in the way the texts are approached.
                        The NLP concepts have a more direct relationship to text style, as it is
                        understood here.<sup id="ftn507" class="w3-btn w3-theme-l3 w3-circle" onclick="document.getElementById('ftn507-modal').style.display='block'">507</sup></p>

                        found for the literary-theoretical and the NLP terms. Here, no direct and
                        specific digital modeling and formalization of literary theoretical concepts is
                        intended. Such a mapping of concepts to the requirements of formal text
                        analysis would need an extensive discussion of the formalization procedures and
                        also the development of entirely new tools or at least advanced adaptations of
                        existing ones.<sup id="ftn508" class="w3-btn w3-theme-l3 w3-circle" onclick="document.getElementById('ftn508-modal').style.display='block'">508</sup> Instead, for the
                        purpose of this dissertation, the problem is approached by assuming a loose
                        connection between literary theoretical terms and existing terms employed in
                        text mining, which is established by clarifying the differences and
                        similarities. This is discussed in <a href="ch4.html#ch4.2.1.2">chapter 4.2.1.2</a>&nbsp; for the relationship between literary themes and
                        topics. In the same way, only loose hypotheses are formulated regarding the
                        relationships between definitions of subgenres of the novel and characteristics
                        of the textual surface. The subgenres are not defined formally and are not
                        directly linked to linguistic properties in a top-down approach. The main
                        reason for this reserve to explicit modeling is that the assignment of the
                        novels in the corpus to the subgenres has not been done on the basis of
                        specific, unambiguous definitions but instead by collecting and interpreting
                        generic signals and attributions of different kinds and provenience. A
                        connection between the textual patterns found and the literary conceptions of
                        the subgenres is explored ex-post, based on the analyses results. That way,
                        mappings between textual evidence and generic categorizations emerge from
                        mainly exploratory procedures and can be described as stylistic cues, stylistic
                        traits, and generic facets.</p>
                     
                     <p id="p607"><span class="paracount w3-blue-grey w3-margin-right"><a href="#p607">607</a></span>In the context of the analysis of subgenres of the novel
                        conducted here, the cues are the feature values that turn out to be distinctive
                        for a particular textual category, but the generic facets are not
                        predetermined. Instead, in the case of classification, the cues are interpreted
                        in terms of the subgenre labels that are associated with the text category to
                        look for generic facets. In the analyses of family resemblance structures, it
                        is examined to what extent the cues characterizing the text types found with
                        different feature sets are related to the subgenres at all – on the different
                        discursive levels that these are defined on. In parallel, connections to other
                        determining textual and contextual factors are checked, e.g., the narrative
                        perspective, the country of origin, or the period of publication. So instead of
                        building a direct chain from theories about the subgenres and their properties
                        to expected stylistic characteristics of the texts, the empirical findings are
                        interpreted regarding their relationship to the subgenre labels and other
                        influencing factors (which could turn out to be relevant facets). The
                        hypothesis that is tested is of a very general kind: “the cues are generic”,
                        meaning that it is tested whether there is a statistically relevant correlation
                        between subgenre labels and the distinctive features of text categories.</p>

                                 <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230304131525/https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/feature_extraction.html">https://web.archive.org/web/20230304131525/https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/feature_extraction.html</a>.</span></span>). For a bag-of-words model, the text is tokenized into
                           individual units, which are then counted. As a result, a corpus is
                           represented by the token counts for each document. In such a model, the
                           order of the units does not play a role anymore. By using word n-grams,
                           i.e., sequences of n words, as the basic unit, the relevance of word order
                           can be reintroduced into a bag-of-words model to a certain extent. Word 2-
                           to 4-grams were chosen to test different ranges of word sequences. While
                           word 2-grams are most frequent in the whole corpus, 3- and 4-grams are
                           closer to whole phrases and are more special features that might be relevant
                           for the distinction of subgenres. Diminishing the unit to character
                           sequences, on the other hand, has several other advantages. First, it makes
                           the model less dependent on the exact spelling of the words. In a word-based
                           approach, a difference in spelling results in different features. In a
                           character-based approach, the words are split into several sequences anyhow
                           so that the effect of orthographic differences in specific parts of the
                           words is smaller. For the corpus at hand, this is of interest because some
                           spelling errors persist as a result of the text digitization process.<sup id="ftn509" class="w3-btn w3-theme-l3 w3-circle" onclick="document.getElementById('ftn509-modal').style.display='block'">509</sup> Second, character n-grams that
                           include blank space and punctuation marks cover aspects of the text string
                           that are not captured by the classical bag-of-words approach, where words
                           are usually split at blank spaces and punctuation marks are ignored. Third,
                           character n-grams can be modeled so that they cover specific linguistic
                           substructures of a morphological, thematic, or stylistic nature. Here, both
                           general character n-grams (called “all” in the above table) and specifically
                           modeled ones (called “word” and “affix-punct”) are used. How the different
                           types of character n-grams are generated is illustrated with an example

                           general character n-grams are very effective for text classification, for
                           example, by author. However, because of the mixed nature of the n-gram
                           types, it is not clear why they are so useful: “Character n-grams are the
                           single most successful feature in authorship attribution [...], but the
                           reason for their success is not well understood. One hypothesis is that
                           character n-grams carry a little bit of everything: lexical content,
                           syntactic content, and even style by means of punctuation and white spaces
                           [...]. While this argument seems plausible, it falls short of a rigorous

                           by designing different types of character n-grams and by using each type
                           separately in authorship attribution tasks to see which kinds of n-grams are
                           successful. They use three types of super categories: n-grams covering
                           morpho-syntactic features (affix-like n-grams, called “affix”), thematic
                           content (word-like n-grams, called “word”), and style (punctuation-based
                           n-grams, called “punct”). The n-gram types associated with the three super
                           categories are called “prefix”, “suffix”, “space-prefix”, and “space-suffix”
                           for the affix group, “whole-word”, “mid-word”, and “multi-word” for the word
                           group, and “beg-punct”, “mid-punct”, and “end-punct” for the
                           punctuation-based group.<sup id="ftn512" class="w3-btn w3-theme-l3 w3-circle" onclick="document.getElementById('ftn512-modal').style.display='block'">512</sup> Sapkota et al.

                           attribution, also the punctuation-based features are very strong.<sup id="ftn513" class="w3-btn w3-theme-l3 w3-circle" onclick="document.getElementById('ftn513-modal').style.display='block'">513</sup></p>

                           propositions of Sapkota et al., but because the issue is subgenre
                           classification and not authorship attribution, the selection of n-gram
                           subtypes is led by hypotheses about the features’ relevance for this
                           categorization task. Here, the subtypes “mid-word” and “multi-word” are
                           selected and combined into a word-based character n-gram feature set (called
                           “word”). It aims to cover aspects of the thematic content that is supposed
                           to be different from subgenre to subgenre. Furthermore, the subtypes
                           “prefix” and “end-punct” are used in a set combining morpho-syntactic and
                           stylistic characteristics (called “affix-punct”). Its goal is to test
                           whether the differences between the subgenres may also be captured with
                           features that are not primarily content-based.<sup id="ftn514" class="w3-btn w3-theme-l3 w3-circle" onclick="document.getElementById('ftn514-modal').style.display='block'">514</sup> The main
                           reason for not only using general character n-grams is that they are
                           dominated by blank spaces and the short most frequent words in different
                           variants if only a certain number of top most frequent items is used (see
                           <a href="#tab28">table 28</a> below illustrating
                           the resulting top most frequent tokens for different types of the general
                           features). The intuition is that these features can hardly be interpreted in
                           terms of the different subgenres. Regarding the chosen range of character
                           numbers, it was decided to use 3-, 4-, and 5-grams because 3-grams are the
                           minimum that is needed to be able to construct the different character
                           n-gram subtypes, and 4-grams have been successfully used in subgenre
                           classification before (<span class="w3-tooltip w3-border-bottom w3-border-blue-grey">Hettinger et al. 2016<span class="w3-text w3-tag w3-round w3-blue-grey w3-left-align w3-padding w3-large" style="position:absolute;left:0;bottom:25px"> Hettinger, Lena, Isabella Reger, Fotis Jannidis,

                           n-gram subtypes. The most evident one is that the number of resulting
                           n-grams varies. The general approach using all types of character n-grams
                           for the example sentence results in 60 3-gram tokens. In contrast, there are
                           only 13 mid-word, eight multi-word, six prefix, and two end-punct tokens, so
                           depending on the rules set up for the character n-gram subtypes, the feature
                           space is reduced considerably because only some types of words or cross-word
                           sequences meet the conditions.</p>

                           chosen so as to cover stylistic features in the narrower sense with only a
                           small number of most frequent words but also a mix of function and content
                           words with several thousand most frequent words. Three types of
                           normalization were chosen for the token counts: term frequency (tf), term
                           frequency – inverse document frequency (tf-idf), and z-scores. The raw,
                           absolute counts are computed as a basis for the normalization steps but are
                           not directly used in the categorization because they depend heavily on the
                           length of the texts, which varies considerably.<sup id="ftn516" class="w3-btn w3-theme-l3 w3-circle" onclick="document.getElementById('ftn516-modal').style.display='block'">516</sup> The term frequency is a relative

                           involve the relationship between the different documents in the corpus, but
                           in a different way than the tf-idf-scores. A z-score measures the number of
                           population standard deviations by which the value of a score is above or
                           below the population mean. This results in positive values for scores that
                           are above the mean, zero values for scores that are equal to the mean, and
                           negative values for scores that are below the mean. The population values
                           are calculated by determining the standard deviation and mean for each

                           that are not so frequent relative to the ones that are very frequent, but in
                           the case of z-scores, it is not decisive in how many of the documents in the
                           corpus they occur. In addition, the range of the resulting values is
                           different than for tf and tf-idf because z-score zero values indicate that a
                           term frequency is equal to the population mean but not that the term in
                           question has a frequency of zero in the document. Instead, terms that do not
                           occur at all in documents get negative z-score values. This different
                           treatment of zero values can have consequences when the texts are
                           categorized.</p>

                           effects of different text lengths by computing relative values per document
                           as in tf and tf-idf. By applying the z-score transformation to absolute
                           values, text length effects would only be controlled indirectly and only to
                           a certain extent because the spread of the absolute values in the corpus is
                           factored in through the standard deviation. A term with a higher standard
                           deviation is penalized by the denominator in the formula if it is above the
                           mean and revalued if it is below the mean. However, very long texts would
                           tend to get higher z-score values. In addition, it would not be clear if
                           higher z-score values are due to text length or to above-average uses of a
                           term. It does therefore make sense to apply the z-score-normalization on top
                           of tf-values, which is done here. By considering several normalization
                           strategies in the feature sets, these can be compared to see which effect
                           they have on the kind of features that turn out to be relevant for the
                           categorization. While tf and tf-idf-scores are generally used in document
                           classification, z-scores have especially been used in the context of

                           between 0.001 and 0.150, for tf-idf-scores between 0.0006 and 0.0581, and
                           for z-scores between 0.999999999999998 and 1.000000000000003, so the
                           absolute values of variance are smallest for the tf- and tf-idf-scores, but
                           the range of variance is smallest for the z-scores.<sup id="ftn527" class="w3-btn w3-theme-l3 w3-circle" onclick="document.getElementById('ftn527-modal').style.display='block'">527</sup> In addition, the
                           distribution of the variances changes from a right-skewed distribution for
                           the tf- and tf-idf-scores to a left-skewed distribution for the z-score
                           values, for which the variance is expressed in relative terms and,
                           therefore, more balanced for the different frequency ranges of the features.
                           With z-scores, most features vary to a similar degree, and only a few
                           features are more consistent throughout the texts in the corpus. A
                           hypothesis of the effect that these differently normalized features have on
                           classification tasks is that less frequent features will have a higher
                           probability of being selected as important features if the variances of the
                           features are more balanced.<sup id="ftn528" class="w3-btn w3-theme-l3 w3-circle" onclick="document.getElementById('ftn528-modal').style.display='block'">528</sup>

                           exclusively function words (propositions, &nbsp;conjunctions, articles, and
                           pronouns) and the particle “no”. In the range 101–110, the nouns “amor” and
                           “vez” enter the list, and there are several verbs and adverbs with general
                           meanings. Range 501–510 contains more specific nouns (“voluntad”, “alegría”,
                           “pasos”), semantically more specific verb forms (“pensar”, “dirigió”), and
                           adjectives (“alto”, “última”). On the positions 1001–1010 and 4091–5000,
                           there are nouns with quite specific meanings (“mozo”, “batalla”, “cólera”,
                           “injusticia”, “sensaciones”, “cuadra”, “distinción”), verbs with more
                           different tenses (gerund: “hablando”, imperfect: “daban”, participle:
                           “apoyada”), and also adjectives and adverbs with increasingly specific
                           meanings (“tranquilo”, “bendito”, “insignificante” and “no_obstante”,
                           “poco_a_poco”, “personalmente”). The word lists from the different frequency
                           sectors show how the feature space gets more complex in terms of the
                           grammatical forms of words that are included and also regarding the semantic
                           specificity of the words as more most frequent items are included.</p>

                           tokens in all frequency ranges. On positions 1–10, the 2-grams consist
                           entirely of function words. In the range 101–110, the particle “no”
                           (“si_no”, “pero_no”), a noun (“la_joven”), and an adjective (“todas_las”)
                           &nbsp;appear as one part of the word combinations. The first verbs are visible in
                           the range 501–510 (“dijo_que”, “era_de”, “que_tiene”). A 2-gram without
                           function words appears in the 4091–5000 most frequent items (“sin_querer”).
                           So due to the combination of two words, the semantic specificity of
                           individual words increases later than for the one-word unit. As for the
                           character n-grams, it is directly visible that the most frequent items of
                           the classic n-grams contain many combinations of white spaces and short
                           function words (e.g., “_de_”, “o_de”, “a_de”). Nouns and verbs can be
                           recognized from the 501–510 MFW group onwards (“adre”, “olvi”, “aber”,
                           “rmas”). The special types of n-grams – the ones only including mid- and
                           multi-word n-grams (“word”) and the ones consisting only of prefixes and
                           word endings with punctuation marks (“affix-punct”) – are more homogeneous
                           throughout the different frequency ranges.</p>

                           the grammatical and semantic characteristics and have the advantage that
                           they cover a broad spectrum of the linguistic material in the full-text
                           basis, the extent of which depends on the chosen frequency range and token
                           unit. Therefore, they lend themselves well to exploratory analyses. A
                           disadvantage coming along is that these features can be difficult to
                           interpret. In the high frequency ranges, this is because semantic elements
                           are scarce, and in the broader frequency spans, it is because of the
                           heterogeneity of the features. The preparation of the semantic features that
                           are used as a counterweight and an alternative to these general features is
                           outlined in the next chapter.</p>

                           topic modeling, a text-mining method that is unsupervised and not
                           deterministic. Unsupervised means that the set of topics is not predefined
                           but emerges from the text collection that is analyzed. A method that is not
                           deterministic does not produce the same output every time it is run, even if
                           the start conditions are fixed, which means that an element of randomness is
                           involved in the process. The goal of topic modeling is to uncover hidden
                           semantic relationships between the words used in the documents of a large
                           text collection and thereby determine what the texts in the collection are
                           about.<sup id="ftn529" class="w3-btn w3-theme-l3 w3-circle" onclick="document.getElementById('ftn529-modal').style.display='block'">529</sup> The semantic relationships between the words are
                           described as <em>hidden</em> because a topic model involves the basic
                           units <em>corpus</em>, <em>document</em>, <em>word</em>, and
                           <em>topic</em>, of which the first three – in their input version –
                           are predefined structures and processable parts of the text collection’s
                           initial state. The topics, on the other hand, constitute a medium layer
                           between the words and the document, or the words and the corpus. The topic
                           layer is inferred from the distributional characteristics of the words in
                           the documents with a probabilistic approach but is not inherently manifest
                           in the text strings and their structural organization. The basic idea comes
                           from the field of distributional semantics and was pointedly put by J. R.
                           Firth already in 1957: “You shall know a word by the company it keeps!”

                           The essence of the quote is that words that repeatedly precede and follow a
                           particular word of interest in a defined textual context contribute to its
                           meaning so that words that occur in the same contexts tend to have similar
                           meanings. This distributional hypothesis is also the theoretical basis for

                           “corpus”, and “topic” have specific meanings. <em>Words</em> correspond
                           to tokens that the text is split into and the tokens that are selected for
                           the topic modeling analysis. They can but need not concur with words in a
                           linguistic sense, depending on how the tokens are defined. Often a list of
                           stop words is applied before the topic model is built so that not all the
                           words that are part of the initial text string stay in the resulting model.
                           The goal is to remove words that carry little semantic value, such as
                           function words, in order to get topics that consist mainly of content words
                           whose distributional relationships are easy to interpret as being of a
                           semantic kind. The term “document” has different meanings, depending on the
                           level on which it is used in a topic modeling workflow. In the narrow sense,
                           “document” is defined as a structure resulting from the topic modeling
                           process. In a wider sense, though, “document” also has a special meaning as
                           an input structure for the topic modeling algorithm. To be able to
                           differentiate between these different uses of the term “document”, they are
                           distinguished here by indexing the term. For the purpose of this
                           dissertation, <em>document<sub>S</sub></em> means the
                           original source document in the form of a continuous text string of
                           characters, <em>document<sub>In-1</sub></em> is the input
                           document that the topic modeling algorithm gets, <em>document<sub>In-2</sub></em> is the input document that the topic
                           modeling algorithm creates internally and uses as a basis for the modeling
                           process, and <em>document<sub>Out</sub></em> is the
                           output document resulting in the final topic model.</p>

                           that constitute the contextual frame in which the co-occurrence of the words

                           or articles. Alternatively, they can be combinations of documents<sub>S</sub> or subparts of them. In practice, the size of the
                           documents<sub>In-1</sub> for topic modeling is often
                           chosen with the aim of balancing the length of the text units and optimizing
                           them for the algorithm to produce good results. Usually, very long texts and
                           texts with a significant variance in length, such as novels, are segmented

                           are treated as stop words and are not included in the word count matrix.
                           Furthermore, all the tokens are converted to lowercase before counting them.
                           Punctuation marks and blank spaces are removed, and the order of the words
                           is suspended. Already in this single sentence, the counts give an impression
                           of the kind of words that dominate from a quantitative point of view: “de”
                           (7), “la” (3), and “el” (2), which are all function words. <a href="#tab30">Table 30</a>&nbsp;shows how the matrix is

                           morphological information is lost, and by selecting only one type of word
                           category, the initial sentence is reduced to content buzzwords. Furthermore,

                           <em>corpus<sub>In-1</sub></em> as the collection of

                           have been preprocessed by stop word removal, linguistic annotation and
                           selection, or chunking. The <em>corpus<sub>In-2</sub></em> is the collection of documents<sub>In-2</sub>, which is a matrix of terms and their counts per

                           Technically, a topic is a probability distribution over words. For each word

                           all the words in the corpus vocabulary and that the differences between the
                           topics are the result of the different weights that the words have in each
                           topic. When humans interpret topics, usually, they only examine a certain
                           number of words – those with the highest probability. The semantics of the
                           topics emerges from the combination of high-probability words. A human
                           inspector can evaluate the semantic relationships between the terms and
                           label the topics with titles. A topic title can consist of individual words
                           but also descriptions. In the above example, topic 77 could be entitled
                           “love” or “love and feelings” and topic 10 “crime” or “crime and society”.
                           Computers can also evaluate the resulting topics by calculating the
                           similarity and semantic relationships of the most important terms in each
                           topic by using external semantic resources, for example, word
                           embeddings,<sup id="ftn537" class="w3-btn w3-theme-l3 w3-circle" onclick="document.getElementById('ftn537-modal').style.display='block'">537</sup> word nets,<sup id="ftn538" class="w3-btn w3-theme-l3 w3-circle" onclick="document.getElementById('ftn538-modal').style.display='block'">538</sup> or dictionaries. Computers could also
                           label topics, for example, by finding superordinate terms. Nevertheless, for
                           creating the topics, no explicit semantic knowledge is necessary because the
                           algorithm bases the assumptions on the relationships between the terms in a
                           topic only on statistical, distributional patterns. Another advantage of
                           topic modeling is that polysemy is not problematic. As every word occurs in
                           every topic, the same word can be important in several topics where its
                           meaning is determined by the surrounding words. In the table, the
                           “probability” column indicates how probable a word is in a specific topic,
                           and the “count” column shows how often a word has been assigned to a topic
                           across all documents. When the counts are compared, the love topic is more
                           important in the corpus than the crime topic because the number of tokens
                           assigned to it is higher. In total, the love topic has 95,452 token
                           assignments, and the crime topic has only 13,644.<sup id="ftn539" class="w3-btn w3-theme-l3 w3-circle" onclick="document.getElementById('ftn539-modal').style.display='block'">539</sup>
                           Inside each topic, the probabilities indicate the relative importance of
                           each word. In the love topic, the first words have higher probabilities than
                           the first words of the crime topic. However, the differences between the
                           probabilities decrease for the lower word ranks, which means that the love
                           topic is more dominated by a few very important words than the crime
                           topic.</p>

                           novels’ identifiers in Conha19 (“nh0217”) and the numbers of the text
                           segments that served as documents<sub>In-1</sub> (“§0030”).
                           To be able to evaluate the probabilities of the topics in the entire novels,
                           the values for the individual segments have to be aggregated again, for
                           example, by using average probabilities. The different probability values
                           show how important the topics are in the documents<sub>Out</sub>. Regarding the love topic (topic 10) and the crime topic (topic
                           77), the table shows that the segment of the first document in the list
                           (“nh0217§0030”) has a higher probability for the love topic than the other
                           two segments from other documents and the third segment (“nh0103§0012”) has
                           a higher probability for the crime topic than the preceding ones. The
                           identifier “nh0217” belongs to the novel “El espejo de Amarilis” (1902, MX)
                           by Laura Méndez de Cuenca and “nh0103” to the novel “El mendigo de San
                           Ángel” (1865, MX) by Niceto de Zamacois. The first one is a novel of customs
                           involving romantic plot elements, and the latter is a historical novel. The
                           results of the topic model seem reasonable, since a prominent love topic can
                           be expected in a novel with a romantic plot, and it is also plausible that
                           the crime topic would carry greater weight in a historical novel.</p>

                           is defined as “Die einem Text zugrundeliegende Problem- oder

                           corresponds roughly to the English term “theme”. This sense of
                           <em>topic</em> is different from the topics<sub>TM</sub> resulting from topic modeling<sup id="ftn544" class="w3-btn w3-theme-l3 w3-circle" onclick="document.getElementById('ftn544-modal').style.display='block'">544</sup> in that it is defined on a more
                           abstract level. The underlying theme of a text can be interpreted from its
                           linguistic material but does not necessarily have to be directly present in
                           terms of formulations using the word or words that describe the theme. For
                           example, one could think of a short story describing a romantic dinner and
                           containing dialogues of a couple, but in which the word <em>love</em> is
                           never used. Nevertheless, a reader could conclude that the central topic of
                           the story is just love.</p>

                           closer to the textual surface. A topic model captures how topics are
                           realized in text segments. However, to find one or several central themes of
                           a text, the topics<sub>TM</sub> need to be interpreted on a

                           logical-semantically defined categories that express the relationship of

                           its central topic. They mention justification and specification as examples
                           of such relational categories. Obviously, the same central topic can be
                           unfolded in different ways. Brinker, Cölfen, and Pappert also define a set
                           of basic forms of thematic unfolding: descriptive, narrative, explicative,
                           and argumentative thematic unfolding.<sup id="ftn546" class="w3-btn w3-theme-l3 w3-circle" onclick="document.getElementById('ftn546-modal').style.display='block'">546</sup> Brinker, Cölfen, and
                           Pappert stress that the thematic unfolding is influenced significantly by
                           communicative and situational factors, such as the intention or purpose of
                           the communication, which leads to several different possibilities of
                           unfolding the same central topic. However, little is known about the factors
                           which have an effect on the exact unfolding. From the point of view of
                           digital literary studies and especially stylistics, this means that also
                           stylistic intentions can have an influence on the thematic unfolding, or,
                           looked at from another perspective, that the exact thematic unfolding can be
                           interpreted as an intended or unintended stylistic effect. The distribution
                           of topics<sub>TM</sub> in the documentsOut of a topic model
                           could be interpreted as the result of thematic unfolding. On the level of
                           the corpus<sub>Out</sub>, the specific set of topics<sub>TM</sub> can be understood as resulting from the thematic
                           unfolding across all documents in the text collection. The thematic
                           unfolding itself, as defined by the combination of relational and
                           logical-semantical categories, though, is located on a more abstract level,
                           which is intermediate between the topics<sub>TM</sub> and the
                           theme of the text. Brinker, Cölfen, and Pappert point out that the theme or
                           central topic of the text is the shortest possible summary of the textual
                           content and that only a reader’s interpretation can achieve this reduction:

                           texts. In a contribution to a conference panel on drama analysis, Schöch and
                           Rißler-Pipka analyzed the distribution of argumentative, narrative,
                           descriptive, and discursive topics in 1,100 novels, 800 dramatic texts, and
                           1.8 million Wikipedia articles in French to see if the proportions of topic
                           types vary by genre.<sup id="ftn547" class="w3-btn w3-theme-l3 w3-circle" onclick="document.getElementById('ftn547-modal').style.display='block'">547</sup> Moreover, different forms of thematic unfolding

                           the core interest of literary studies is much more the specific literary
                           function of the texts, which manifests itself in particular linguistic and

                           on the textual surface, is closer to the concern of literary scholarship

                           between content and form more directly. In computational literary studies,
                           topic modeling has indeed been taken up with interest and applied to a

Literary
                           scholars that used topic modeling soon discovered that the relationships
                           between the terms in the topics are not necessarily content-related and do
                           not even need to be of a semantic nature. When applied to literary texts,
                           topic modeling can also discover rhetoric structures and elements of
                           discourse (<span class="w3-tooltip w3-border-bottom w3-border-blue-grey">Jannidis 2016,

                           content analysis, has been developed and optimized on the basis of
                           non-literary text types. It also indicates that the distributional
                           hypothesis could be understood in a wider sense as not only applying to
                           semantic relationships but also to discourse relationships. However, to what
                           extent non-thematic topics can be produced also depends on the kind of
                           preprocessing applied to the texts. If only nouns are processed, it is more
                           probable that the words in the topics are held together by semantic,
                           thematic, and content-related connections.</p>

                           are selected, aiming at semantic and content-related topics. This way of

                           the optimization interval, that is, the interval at which the Dirichlet
                           hyperparameters for the LDA model are optimized during the iterations of the
                           topic modeling process. The two hyperparameters, alpha (α) and beta (β),
                           influence the form of the topic probability distribution over words and the
                           document probability distribution over topics, respectively. The lower the
                           parameters are, the more the resulting distribution is concentrated on
                           single values. Otherwise, it is more even. It follows that a lower alpha
                           value leads to topics with a few dominant and many unimportant words and a

                           was followed: first, the linguistically annotated versions of the TEI corpus
                           files were used to extract the noun lemmas for each novel and to create
                           full-text files only containing the nouns. As for the general features, also
                           here proper names were excluded.<sup id="ftn553" class="w3-btn w3-theme-l3 w3-circle" onclick="document.getElementById('ftn553-modal').style.display='block'">553</sup> Then, the novels are segmented into
                           chunks of 1,000 tokens, which are fed into the topic modeling workflow. A
                           stopword list consisting of the 50 most frequent nouns and of proper names
                           and place names was created and used by MALLET.<sup id="ftn554" class="w3-btn w3-theme-l3 w3-circle" onclick="document.getElementById('ftn554-modal').style.display='block'">554</sup> For text
                           segmentation, modeling, and post-processing of the results, the tool tmw
                           (Topic Modeling Workflow) was used. Tmw was developed by Christof Schöch and
                           Daniel Schlör in the context of the CLiGS project. It is a set of python
                           scripts that especially supports the pre- and post-processing of the texts
                           that are used for the topic modeling. It also includes a set of functions to
                           visualize the topic modeling results. Its development is organized in a
                           GitHub repository (see <span class="w3-tooltip w3-border-bottom w3-border-blue-grey">Schöch and Schlör 2017<span class="w3-text w3-tag w3-round w3-blue-grey w3-left-align w3-padding w3-large" style="position:absolute;left:0;bottom:25px">Schöch, Christof, and Daniel Schlör. 2017. “tmw –

                           slightly adapted to create the topic models used here. Mainly the routines
                           for calling the core functions were changed.<sup id="ftn556" class="w3-btn w3-theme-l3 w3-circle" onclick="document.getElementById('ftn556-modal').style.display='block'">556</sup> An important feature of tmw is the
                           text segmenting procedure. Before the novels are processed with MALLET, they
                           are split into segments of a defined length,<sup id="ftn557" class="w3-btn w3-theme-l3 w3-circle" onclick="document.getElementById('ftn557-modal').style.display='block'">557</sup> so that the topic models are created for the
                           segments, not the entire texts. In the post-process step, tmw recombines the
                           segments of the novels and calculates average probability values. The
                           segmenting step is considered important to counter the effects of different
                           text lengths, and the recombination of the segments is necessary to be able
                           to interpret the results per novel. Finally, because topic modeling is not
                           deterministic, five different models were produced for each parameter
                           constellation.<sup id="ftn558" class="w3-btn w3-theme-l3 w3-circle" onclick="document.getElementById('ftn558-modal').style.display='block'">558</sup> Through the different combinations of

                           general characteristics of the feature sets are evaluated here. Unlike for
                           MFW, the number of zero values is not relevant for the topics, though, as no
                           zero values were found in the whole set of topic models created for the
                           corpus of Spanish-American novels. This means that each topic has at least
                           some probability in each document, even if it is very small.<sup id="ftn559" class="w3-btn w3-theme-l3 w3-circle" onclick="document.getElementById('ftn559-modal').style.display='block'">559</sup> Another aspect of the models that was
                           evaluated is the coherence of the topics. The tool MALLET includes a set of
                           diagnostic measures which can be saved as an additional output of the topic
                           modeling process and can be used to assess the formal quality of the topic
                           models. One of the measures is the coherence metric, which evaluates whether
                           the words in a topic actually occur together in the texts of the corpus.
                           This is examined by taking each pair of top words in a topic and calculating
                           “the log of the probability that a document containing at least one instance
                           of the higher-ranked word also contains at least one instance of the

                           zero mean that words co-occur more often. For the models at hand, the number
                           of top words was set to 50. As the coherence measure depends on the top
                           words, it is expected that lower numbers of top words lead to coherence
                           scores that a closer to zero than the scores for models with a higher number
                           of top words. However, as the number of top words is the same for all the
                           models here, the resulting coherence values can be compared. A summary is

                           topic model was calculated. This was done for each combination of the number
                           of topics and optimization intervals. As there are five different models for
                           each setting, their mean coherences were averaged. The results show two
                           trends. First, the coherence of the topics tends to decrease with an
                           increasing number of topics, and second, the coherence also decreases when
                           the optimization intervals are bigger (so that the hyperparameters are
                           optimized less often). What can also be seen is that the values drop more
                           for bigger optimization intervals than for higher numbers of topics. It
                           makes sense that less optimization leads to topics that are “further away”
                           from the actual distribution of words in the corpus so that the topics tend
                           to be more abstract. It is more difficult to explain that higher topic
                           numbers produce less coherent topics. A hypothesis for this is that with
                           more topics, many of them are more special, so it is less probable that
                           texts containing some top words of a topic also contain all the others.
                           Interestingly, though, the coherence values go up again from 90 to 100
                           topics for the lower optimization intervals. Regarding the usage of the
                           topic models for subgenre categorization, the coherence values are of
                           interest in two ways. One is the question of whether models with more
                           coherent topics are better feature sets for classification, and the other is
                           whether a better formal coherence of the topics also facilitates their
                           interpretation as features related to the subgenres. Four example topics are
                           shown in figure xxx to get an impression of the kind of topics that are part
                           of the different models.

                           important words. The top left topic stems from a model with 50 topics and an
                           optimization interval of 50, and the top right from a model also with 50
                           topics but without hyperparameter optimization. The bottom left topic is
                           part of a model that has 100 topics and an optimization interval of 50, and
                           the bottom right topic was produced in a model also with 100 topics but
                           without hyperparameter optimization. With optimization, the topics can be
                           ranked because they can have different overall probabilities in the corpus.
                           The tenth most important topic was selected from the two models with
                           optimization (as indicated by the first number in parentheses after the
                           topic number). Although the overall number of topics is different in the two
                           models, the tenth topic is similar in both. Without optimization, all the
                           topics in the model have the same weight in the whole corpus, so of the two
                           models without optimization, two topics with similar words were selected.
                           The two topics to the left can be interpreted as representing a ball. In the
                           top left topic, the three most important words are “baile”, “salón”, and
                           “amor”, and in the bottom left one, “baile”, “salón”, and “brazo”. The other
                           words in the topics are also related to a ball situation and cover music,
                           dance, social life and conversation, and dresses. The main difference
                           between the topic from the 50-topics model and the one from the 100-topics
                           model is that in the former, words about love and family relationships are
                           more prominent (“amor”, “mamá”, “novio”, “corazón”, and “papá”), suggesting
                           that here the ball situation is connected with central plot elements,
                           whereas the latter has a stronger focus on the ball as a social event and
                           seems to be more descriptive, and hence more specialized (“brazo”, “traje”,
                           “movimiento”, “efecto”, “concurrencia”, “reunión”). The two topics to the
                           right can be interpreted as covering travel to or in a city. In the topic
                           from the 50-topics model, the three most important words are “coche”,
                           “carruaje”, “ciudad”, and the three top words in the topic from the
                           100-topics model are “coche”, “carruaje”, and “cochero”. As in the case of
                           the ball topics, also here the first topic includes some top words which add
                           elements from another type of situation. The word “hotel” is more important
                           in that topic than in the second one, and there are the words “mesa”,
                           “juego”, “jugador”, “reloj”, and “oro”, which seem to describe a situation
                           at a gaming table. Such a subtopic is not noticeable in the second topic.
                           Overall, from the point of view of a human interpreter, all four topics
                           stemming from models that were created with different topic modeling
                           parameters have good quality and are semantically coherent, with differences
                           only on the level of detail. Interestingly, the two topics from the
                           100-topics model give a more coherent impression than the two topics from
                           the 50-topics model, which is contrary to the outcome of the MALLET
                           diagnostics and shows that the degree of formal coherence does not
                           necessarily coincide with the semantic coherence that can be observed in the
                           topics by a human interpreter. In any case, topics as semantic features are
                           mostly easy to interpret, so it can be expected that the feature sets
                           resulting from topic modeling are useful for gaining new insights into the
                           subgenres of the novel.</p>

                     <p id="p650"><span class="paracount w3-blue-grey w3-margin-right"><a href="#p650">650</a></span>Two types of categorization methods are used to analyze the
                        novels of Conha19. These are based on the sets of general features (most
                        frequent words), and of semantic features (topics) that were presented in <a href="ch4.html#ch4.2.1">chapter 4.2.1</a>&nbsp;above. As a first
                        step, a classification is applied. It aims primarily to select the best feature
                        set of each type (general and semantic). It also has the purpose of examining
                        how well the novels can be classified by subgenre at all. This is done in <a href="ch4.html#ch4.2.2.1">chapter 4.2.2.1</a>. As a second step,
                        a family resemblance analysis is conducted in <a href="ch4.html#ch4.2.2.2">chapter 4.2.2.2</a>, which is based on text similarity
                        calculations and rankings, network analysis, and community detection. This
                        specific combination of techniques is proposed here as one possible
                        implementation of the family resemblance concept. In contrast to the
                        classification, the family resemblance analysis does not start from predefined
                        subgenre labels. It is an open and exploratory technique that uses the
                        similarities between the texts of the novels – as represented in the feature
                        sets – to group them. Only afterwards are the resulting <em>families</em>
                        of texts compared to the subgenre labels and other metadata categories. By
                        using the kind of feature sets that were successful also in the classification
                        tasks, the family resemblance analysis starts from a reliable basis regarding
                        the relevance of the features for categorization by genre. On the other hand,
                        the influence of other contextual and textual factors, such as authorship, time
                        period, country, narrative perspective, or setting, on the resulting
                        categories, can be better explored in a bottom-up approach, i.e., in a
                        feature-based categorization approach without prior labeling of the texts. The
                        family resemblance analysis also has the advantage that the categories are
                        constituted based on a network of relationships between individual texts. It
                        does not presuppose that every feature is present in every text in the same
                        way. Partial overlaps in the feature distributions are enough to connect the
                        texts. Like that, texts can be distinct in detail but similar in general and
                        still be grouped together. This is a second kind of openness of the family
                        resemblance method compared to classification. The details about the two
                        methods are discussed in the respective subchapters, including the algorithms
                        and implementations used to apply them.</p>
                     
                     <p id="p651"><span class="paracount w3-blue-grey w3-margin-right"><a href="#p651">651</a></span>In the bibliography and the corpus, all kinds of subgenre labels
                        were collected for the novels and sorted according to a discursive model for
                        subgenre terms. A quantitatively relevant selection of them was analyzed on a
                        metadata level in <a href="ch4.html#ch4.1.5.3">chapter
                           4.1.5.3</a> (“Subgenre Labels Selected for Text Analysis”). In this
                        chapter on categorization, further selections are made for constellations of
                        subgenres that are analyzed on the textual level. There are several reasons for
                        the selections. First, critical literature is only available for some of the
                        discursive levels of subgenre terms and only for some of the subgenres on those
                        levels. The existence of critical approaches to the subgenres is important in
                        order to be able to formulate hypotheses based on previous knowledge and
                        research results. In addition it shows which subgenres have been at the center
                        of interest of literary scholars. Referring back to the existing discourse on
                        subgenres of the novel in literary scholarship increases the chance that the
                        quantitative text analytical approaches also find a response there.
                        Furthermore, there is the chance that previous results are confirmed or
                        critically examined from a different methodological standpoint. On the other
                        hand, discursive levels of subgenre terms and specific types of subgenres that
                        have not been the focus of literary scholars yet can be a new ground that is
                        worth exploring with the help of digital text analysis. As formulated in the
                        chapter on the features (see <a href="ch4.html#ch4.2.1">chapter
                           4.2.1</a>&nbsp;above), in these cases, the main hypothesis to be checked is
                        whether there is any detectable and significant relationship between the
                        subgenre labels and the texts. Here, the focus is on the quantitatively and
                        qualitatively most relevant and critically established subgenres from the
                        levels of theme and literary current. As thematic subgenres, the three
                        subgenres with the most frequent primary labels in the corpus have been
                        selected: historical novels, sentimental novels, and novels of customs. For the
                        literary currents, romantic, realist, and naturalistic novels are compared.</p>
                     
                     <p id="p652"><span class="paracount w3-blue-grey w3-margin-right"><a href="#p652">652</a></span>With this selection, two levels of the discursive model of
                        subgenre terms are covered, and different types of label sources are included.
                        The labels related to theme and literary current are critically established,
                        preferably based on interpretations made by other scholars who have classified
                        the novels in question. If no such classifications were available, the labels
                        were assigned by the author of this study based on explicit and implicit
                        subgenre signals that were collected and encoded in detail for the novels in
                        the corpus.<sup id="ftn560" class="w3-btn w3-theme-l3 w3-circle" onclick="document.getElementById('ftn560-modal').style.display='block'">560</sup> Another aspect that has
                        been pointed out here is that one novel can have several different subgenre
                        labels, even on a single discursive level. As a simple approach to model
                        multiple subgenre terms of the same kind, one primary label was selected for
                        the levels of theme and literary current, marking the remaining ones as
                        secondary. In the classification analysis, these primary labels are employed.
                        Another option would have been to conduct a multilabel classification, allowing
                        one text to pertain to several different subgenres at once. A text analysis
                        considering this more complex and, at the same time, diffusing modeling of
                        subgenre assignments is left as a future task. Furthermore, the textual
                        analysis of the difference between critically established thematic labels, on
                        the one hand, and purely explicit and historical thematic labels, on the other
                        hand (i.e., above all the <em>novelas históricas</em> and the <em>novelas
                           de costumbres</em>), is not conducted here. It is assumed that such an
                        analysis will bring to light different nuances of the historical and the
                        current contemporary conceptions of the subgenres, and to capture these on the
                        level of the texts is considered an advanced task for the future. However, as
                        the metadata about the subgenre terms and their assignment to the novels has
                        been captured on all these levels, the information can still be used to analyze
                        their impact as influencing factors on the results of the text analysis,
                        together with the other metadata categories. It can be expected that a reduced
                        setup of subgenre comparisons leads to clearer results and facilitates their
                        interpretation, especially when an open approach such as the family resemblance
                        analysis is used. As there are no simple measures to evaluate the categories
                        emerging from a network-based approach yet, a manual inspection of the results
                        and underlying feature distributions is indispensable in that case.<sup id="ftn561" class="w3-btn w3-theme-l3 w3-circle" onclick="document.getElementById('ftn561-modal').style.display='block'">561</sup></p>

                           difficult or not possible to know the rules that connect a certain type of
                           data to a characteristic that is attributed to this data. In the case of
                           genres, this means that there are texts about which we have some knowledge:
                           we know, for example, which words are used in the texts, how they are
                           organized syntagmatically, to which grammatical categories they belong, and
                           so on. On the other hand, we know that certain texts belong to specific
                           genres because it is indicated in the paratexts of their publication,
                           because the books they are published in are offered in a genre-specific
                           section of a bookstore, because some literary scholar has said that they
                           belong to a genre, etc. We may have some ideas about how the input
                           characteristics of the texts are related to the output labels, but we do not
                           know enough to be able to design corresponding algorithms for the computer
                           that could convert the input (the features) to the output (the category

                           labeled with some output value to learn the rules from it. This is done by
                           using a model of a predefined type (for example, a linear model aiming to
                           describe connections in the data with linear relationships), and adapting
                           and optimizing this model by setting its parameters in a way that fits the
                           data and their labels best. The goal of training such a model is to be able
                           to automatically label new cases of the data by applying the trained model
                           to them, i.e., to make predictions. In the case of genre, this would mean
                           being able to assign a genre label to a new, unknown text by handing it to
                           the computer. As Alpaydin states, another goal can be to inspect which part
                           of the data the computer used to make the predictions to learn something
                           about the rules that connect the input data to the output labels. For the
                           genres, this would mean reproducing which features of the texts, for
                           example, the frequency of a certain word or the distribution of word
                           categories, really are relevant for the decision to assign the texts to
                           certain genres.<sup id="ftn562" class="w3-btn w3-theme-l3 w3-circle" onclick="document.getElementById('ftn562-modal').style.display='block'">562</sup></p>

                           unsupervised and supervised learning methods. In an unsupervised case,
                           knowledge is extracted from the data without information about some output
                           value or category. The data may, for example, be grouped based only on how
                           the features are distributed. In a supervised approach, on the other hand, a
                           specific outcome is known for a given input. Classification belongs to the
                           latter group because the goal is to find a model for the relationships
                           between the input data and the output class labels (<span class="w3-tooltip w3-border-bottom w3-border-blue-grey">Müller and Guido 2016, 27, 133<span class="w3-text w3-tag w3-round w3-blue-grey w3-left-align w3-padding w3-large" style="position:absolute;left:0;bottom:25px">Müller, Andreas C., and Sarah Guido. 2016.

                           the specific data set. For the corpus of nineteenth-century Spanish-American
                           novels at hand, for instance, this implies that a classifier trained to
                           recognize the difference between historical and non-historical novels should
                           be able to make correct predictions for another corpus. A different corpus
                           may be built using the same population of nineteenth-century
                           Spanish-American novels as represented in the bibliography but selecting
                           different authors and works. This would mean that the classifier can tell us
                           something about the general difference between historical and non-historical
                           novels of that period and cultural-geographical context, and not just about
                           how the genre <em>novela histórica</em> is realized in the specific
                           works in the selected corpus. By training a classifier not just on
                           nineteenth-century but also on twentieth-century novels, one could create a
                           model that is independent of the time period and learn a more abstract
                           data-based concept of the historical novel. Similarly, also the
                           cultural-geographical and linguistic context could be broadened or narrowed
                           down, for example, to only learn about the historical novel in Mexico. As in
                           literary studies in general, these examples show that also in digital
                           literary studies applying machine learning and classification, the design of
                           the corpus is decisive for the kind of conclusions that can be drawn from
                           the text analysis results.<sup id="ftn563" class="w3-btn w3-theme-l3 w3-circle" onclick="document.getElementById('ftn563-modal').style.display='block'">563</sup></p>

                           context, a supervised machine learning task is usually performed in several
                           successive steps. First, part of the data is used as a <em>training
                              set</em> to build the model and find the best parameters for it.
                           Another part of the data is kept as a <em>validation set</em> to be able
                           to check how well the model performs if it has to classify data on which it
                           has not been initially trained. Subsequently, the model is refined by
                           adjusting its parameters so that it performs best on the validation set.
                           That way, the validation set becomes part of the training process of the
                           model. By repeating the process of splitting the data into different
                           training and validation sets (<em>cross-validation</em>), the effect of
                           random chance in selecting a specific training set can be reduced. The
                           parameters of the model should be fit in a way that makes the model neither
                           too specific for the data (<em>overfitting</em>) nor too general
                           (<em>underfitting</em>) (Alpaydin 2016, 39–41). If, for example, a
                           model is built with the goal of differentiating between historical and
                           sentimental nineteenth-century Spanish-American novels, but the training set
                           is dominated by a certain type of historical novel, then it would be
                           disadvantageous if the model learns too many details about the special types
                           of historical novels when compared to sentimental novels. Such special types
                           of historical novels are, for example, novels that were part of large series
                           of historical novels published by a few Mexican authors, such as the
                           “Episodios nacionales mexicanos” (1902–1903, MX) by Victoriano Salado
                           Álvarez, or the “Leyendas históricas de la independencia” (1886–1913, MX) by
                           Ireneo Paz. If other types of historical novels are presented to the model
                           as a test case, it could happen that the specialized model is not able to
                           classify them correctly. This could happen, for instance, if an individual
                           Argentine or Cuban novel dealing with the conquest or colonial times is
                           presented to a model trained with Mexican historical novels. Such a model
                           would be overfitting. Conversely, if a model does not predict the classes of
                           the data it was trained on well, it has probably learned too little about
                           the data structures representing the classes and is underfitting. Finally, a
                           fully trained and validated model can be used with a third part of the data,
                           the <em>test set</em>, which has not been part of the training cycle at
                           all.</p>

                           best parameters for it are decisive for the quality of a classification
                           task, but also how – based on what data – the instances of the classes are
                           represented in the machine learning process. The selection of the text
                           features for genre classification should be based on good hypotheses about
                           their relevance for the problem. Here, it was decided to use the most
                           frequent words and topics as two comparatively generic types of features to
                           classify the nineteenth-century Spanish-American novels by subgenre. Both
                           types of features have already been used successfully in the classification

                           was decided to compare three different kinds of classifiers: k-Nearest
                           Neighbours (KNN), linear Support Vector Machine (linear SVM), and Random
                           Forest (RF). By comparing the results of different classifiers, it can be
                           assessed if the different feature sets work well or not with all of them or
                           if this depends on the kind of classifier. The importance that single
                           features have in the classification process can also be checked by comparing
                           their relevance in different models. In general, many different algorithms

                           this algorithm, three parameters are varied: the number of neighbors taken
                           into consideration for the classification decision, the method applied to
                           weight neighbors, and the distance metric used to calculate how far the
                           neighbors are away from the data point in question. A uniform weight means
                           that all neighbors have the same influence on the decision, whereas a
                           distance-based weight means that neighbors that are nearer are weighted

                           decision boundary for the classification. The most important parameter to
                           vary in an SVM is the C parameter, which regularizes the learning process.
                           The higher the value of C is, the more the model tries to learn a function
                           that fits the training data in the best possible way, and a lower C means
                           that the model tries to find low coefficients (<span class="w3-tooltip w3-border-bottom w3-border-blue-grey">Müller and Guido 2016, 58–60<span class="w3-text w3-tag w3-round w3-blue-grey w3-left-align w3-padding w3-large" style="position:absolute;left:0;bottom:25px">Müller, Andreas C., and Sarah Guido. 2016.

                           for the classification is the size of the different classes, that is, the
                           number of novels in each class. Because the number of novels for each
                           subgenre differs in the corpus, undersampling is used here as a strategy to
                           balance the classes. This means that the number of instances of each class
                           is set to the size of the smallest class. There are, for example, 116
                           romantic novels and 85 non-romantic novels in the corpus. With
                           undersampling, the subgenre constellation “<em>novela romántica</em>
                           versus other” is performed with a set of 85 romantic novels, which are
                           selected randomly from all the romantic novels, and 85 non-romantic novels.
                           The undersampling process is repeated ten times for each setting to make
                           sure that the random selection does not have too much influence on the
                           results. For the topic models, all five models that were produced for each
                           combination of topic modeling parameters are used, and the resulting scores
                           are averaged.</p>

                           performed for each type of classifier, with the different classifier
                           parameters and for each feature and data combination. A grid search consists
                           in creating a grid of parameter values, for example, the different values
                           for the number of neighbors and metrics for KNN, and running a set of
                           classifications to find out which combinations of the parameters work best.
                           A method that facilitates this procedure in the context of Machine Learning
                           is scikit-learn’s GridSearchCV, which was used here (<span class="w3-tooltip w3-border-bottom w3-border-blue-grey">Scikit-learn developers

The method includes the possibility of performing
                           cross-validation. Here, 10-fold cross-validation was used, meaning that each
                           combination of parameters is tested in ten different splits of training and
                           test data.<sup id="ftn572" class="w3-btn w3-theme-l3 w3-circle" onclick="document.getElementById('ftn572-modal').style.display='block'">572</sup> Part of the results that

                           parameter values resulting from average test scores over all folds. Here the
                           results of the parameter study were evaluated by counting how often each
                           parameter value had the first rank, that is, how often it led to the best

                           the test scores themselves are not considered, so rather than finding the
                           parameter values which lead to the highest scores for specific data and
                           feature combinations, it was analyzed which values yield the best score most
                           often for all the different settings. The goal was to find parameter values
                           that are generally a good choice so that they could be used for all the
                           following analyses. However, as the classifications were performed
                           separately with the two main feature types (general, MFW-based features
                           versus topics),<sup id="ftn574" class="w3-btn w3-theme-l3 w3-circle" onclick="document.getElementById('ftn574-modal').style.display='block'">574</sup> different parameter values were
                           chosen for them whenever the results of the parameter study suggested that.
                           The main reason for keeping the main types of feature sets separate is to
                           allow for their interpretation in terms of different levels of text

                           <code>weight</code>, and <code>metric</code>. Concerning the number of
                           neighbors that are decisive for the classification, all three candidates (3,
                           5, and 7) reached the first rank almost equally often. A number of 7
                           neighbors is a bit better than fewer ones (for MFW and for topic features),
                           so this number was used in all the following experiments. Why could a higher
                           number of neighbors be advantageous? One hypothesis is that the novels’
                           individual feature distributions must be checked against several neighboring
                           ones to be able to decide on the subgenre, which means that resemblances to
                           several works are more relevant than the similarity to a few works that
                           represent the subgenre in a homogeneous way.

                           neighbors on the classification decision, distance-based weights work better
                           than uniform weights for both feature types, only slightly in the case of
                           MFW and a bit more for topics, as <a href="#fig46">figure 46</a> shows. Even in this case, the difference between both
                           types of weighting is not striking. A hypothesis to explain the tendency
                           towards distance-based weighting is that the novels rather form classes on
                           relationships of similarity between individual works than on uniform
                           similarities to several other works.</p>

                           clearest for the metric, as shown in <a href="#fig47">figure 47</a>. The Manhattan distance works best in more than half of
                           the cases. Both for MFW and even more for topics, the Manhattan distance
                           reaches the top mean accuracy test score more often than other metrics. This
                           shows that measuring the distance between the feature vectors as they are in
                           the different dimensions (with tf-idf or z-scores) works better than
                           measuring the distance between the vectors in one step. So distances between
                           individual features play an important role in the classification by
                           subgenre. To summarize, for KNN, the parameters are set to 7 neighbors,
                           distance-based weights, and Manhattan metric.

                           results in <a href="#fig48">figure 48</a> show that
                           the value 1 works best for topics. For MFW, a value of 100 leads to the best
                           mean score more often than other values, but the differences are small. As a
                           lower value of C means that the coefficients for the linear model are
                           preferably lower so that the model is less specialized on the data it is
                           trained on, the models that are built with it are more general, which, in
                           principle, is good. A hypothesis to explain that a lower value of C is much
                           better with topic features and not so decisive with MFW is that topics are
                           primarily content-related. When the topics are too specific, they might not
                           be characteristic of the subgenres of the novel but rather of individual
                           texts. Primarily stylistic features, on the other hand, are more flexible
                           when a classifier uses them to build models for subgenres. Because of these
                           results of the parameter study, in the following analyses, the C parameter
                           is set to the value 1 for the topic features and to the value 100 for

                           maximum number of features used in each tree is better determined by taking
                           the logarithm to the basis 2 or the square root of the overall feature
                           number. The results in <a href="#fig49">figure
                              49</a>&nbsp;indicate that the square root is more successful for both MFW and
                           topic features, so this parameter value is used for RF in the following.
                           With the square root, the number of features chosen is higher than with the
                           logarithm. In addition, it increases faster with an increasing number of
                           features, so using more of the features that are available is especially
                           useful when decision trees are built based on MFW, but also when they are
                           built based on topics.

                           that the choice of the parameter values does not make all the difference for
                           the classification results. All of the parameter values reached rank 1 for
                           several data and feature sets, but some are more successful in the majority
                           of cases. By fixing the values for subsequent analyses, a common basis is
                           found for comparing classification results for different subgenres and
                           feature sets, even if this means that for some constellations, the results
                           could still be improved by adjusting the parameters individually.</p>

                           following subchapters on thematic subgenres (<a href="ch4.html#ch4.2.2.1.1">4.2.2.1.1</a>) and literary currents (<a href="ch4.html#ch4.2.2.1.2">4.2.2.1.2</a>), the general
                           classification workflow is outlined here. In a first step, the discursive
                           level on which subgenres are analyzed is chosen (i.e., <em>theme</em> or
                           <em>current</em>). Then the individual subgenres which are contrasted
                           on each level are selected, for instance, <em>novela histórica</em>
                           versus <em>novela sentimental</em> or <em>novela histórica</em>
                           versus all other novels. To keep the evaluation of the classification
                           results simple and comparable, only two classes are used each time. For
                           these, the data is selected so that the classes have the same size. As said
                           before, the data selection process is done randomly and repeated ten times
                           to make sure that the results do not depend on the specific selection. If
                           the two classes always have the same size, the classification baseline can
                           be set at 50&nbsp;% for all the constellations. Next, the classification is
                           performed with the three types of classifiers and all the different feature
                           sets that were prepared. The classifier parameters are fixed with the values
                           that were chosen in the preliminary parameter study, and the classification
                           is performed with 10-fold cross-validation. A graphic overview of the
                           classification workflow is given in <a href="#fig50">figure 50</a>.<sup id="ftn575" class="w3-btn w3-theme-l3 w3-circle" onclick="document.getElementById('ftn575-modal').style.display='block'">575</sup>

                           and topic features work best with which classifier. The best constellation
                           of classifiers and features is chosen for each discursive level. Following
                           the assumption that different kinds of features and hence different levels
                           of style can be decisive for the various discursive levels of subgenres,
                           independent decisions are made for thematic subgenres and literary currents.
                           However, for the different subgenre constellations on the same discursive
                           level, no individual choice is made. Here the best classifier, MFW-based,
                           and topic feature sets found for the discursive level are chosen to further
                           evaluate the results of the subgenre classification. For example, the
                           results for the <em>novela romántica</em> can be directly compared to
                           the results for the <em>novela realista</em>. Beyond inspecting accuracy
                           values and F1 scores, further interpretation of the results is concerned
                           with two aspects: 
                           <ol>
                              
                              <li>the importance of individual features in the feature set for the
                                 classification, for instance, which word n-grams or which topics are
                                 decisive to differentiate between two types of novels, and</li>
                              
                              <li>the number of times that novels are classified correctly or
                                 misclassified.</li>
                              </ol> The first aspect leads to insights about the text types of the
                           subgenres: Which features are characteristic of the subgenres when they are
                           contrasted with others? The second aspect aims to find out which works are
                           typical for specific textual subgenres. Which works are classified correctly
                           most often (the true positives)? Which ones are frequently misclassified and
                           are rather untypical or mixed instances of a subgenre? If a novel has the
                           label of a specific class but is always or almost in every case
                           misclassified (a false negative), it is considered a member of the
                           conventional genre (because it has the corresponding genre label) but not of
                           the literary text type (because it is not recognized as being a member of
                           it). If, on the other hand, a novel is always or almost in every case seen
                           as an instance of the class, but it does not have the label (a false
                           positive), then it is considered a member of the text type (because it is
                           textually similar to the other novels that are part of this type) but not of
                           the conventional literary genre (because it does not have the corresponding
                           label). Finally, novels that do not have the label of the class in question
                           and are never or almost never classified as instances of it (the true
                           negatives) are neither part of the conventional genre nor the text
                           type.<sup id="ftn576" class="w3-btn w3-theme-l3 w3-circle" onclick="document.getElementById('ftn576-modal').style.display='block'">576</sup> That way, the classification
                           results are interpreted in terms of the distinction between conventional
                           literary genre, literary text type, and textual genre to find out the degree
                           to which the conventional genre and a text type that can be associated with
                           it overlap. This gives insight into the textual coherence of the genre as a
                           whole, but it also allows us to find prototypical and untypical members of a
                           genre and to locate individual novels on the levels of convention and text
                           in relationship to the genre they participate in (or not).</p>

                           each run with the ten different data selections in the undersampling process
                           and the ten repetitions in the cross-validation procedure. Therefore, all
                           the values are collected, and the average results are analyzed. For the MFW,
                           the feature importances and classification results for the individual novels
                           can be averaged on the level of the different feature sets (for example, for
                           all the data selections and cross-validations performed with 100 MFW and
                           tf-idf normalization) because the kinds of features stay the same: which
                           ones are the 100 MFW does not change. For the topics, in contrast, it is not
                           possible to summarize the feature importances and novel classifications on
                           such a general level because the topic features are different in each topic
                           model that is produced. Even if the number of topics, the iterations, and
                           optimization intervals are fixed, the topics themselves are not consistent
                           throughout the five topic modeling repetitions because of the probabilistic
                           procedure. So in the case of the topics, one specific topic model must be
                           chosen. Only then the features and the individual classifications of the
                           novels can be evaluated and their importance can be averaged. Here, the
                           first of the five topic models that are produced for each topic model
                           parameter constellation is chosen as a representative.<sup id="ftn577" class="w3-btn w3-theme-l3 w3-circle" onclick="document.getElementById('ftn577-modal').style.display='block'">577</sup></p>

                           specific feature sets are interpreted as sets of literary text types. They
                           are considered sets of text types and not individual text types because the
                           classifiers learn to differentiate between several classes. Because here
                           only two classes are compared each time, two text types are learned, or
                           rather, it is learned how two text types can be delimited and distinguished,
                           one for the positive and the other for the negative class. That they depend
                           on a specific set of textual features means that the text types are
                           constituted on a certain stylistic level (e.g., the 1,000 MFW and all the
                           linguistic material that is covered by them or 50 topics and all the
                           thematic distinctions that can be made based on them). Furthermore, specific
                           stylistic cues are determined for the text types, for instance, specific
                           topics that have great importance as features for the classification. When
                           the results are evaluated, several stylistic cues can be interpreted as
                           forming stylistic traits of the literary text types in question. For
                           instance, if several adjectives and nouns referring to opposites (e.g.,
                           good-bad, city-countryside) turn out to be significant features in an
                           MFW-based model, these stylistic cues can be subsumed as a trait of
                           opposites or antagonisms. When a range of different feature sets is used in
                           several classifications to analyze the same subgenre, such traits can be
                           collected and interpreted as different facets of a text type.</p>

                           models but also by the set of texts that participate in them. However, these
                           texts are not equivalents of the conventional genre. It is not that the
                           texts carrying specific labels are contrasted directly to view their
                           features. Instead, the feature importances that result from trying to
                           classify the novels by their subgenre label are contrasted. In the latter
                           case, the text type consists of the texts that are repeatedly found as true
                           positives plus the ones that are frequently determined as false positives.
                           On the other side, the texts that carry the conventional label but do not
                           fit textually are not included when the importance of the different features
                           is evaluated. In the next chapter, the classification results for the

                              are the <em>novela histórica</em>, with 67 novels; the <em>novela
                                 sentimental</em>, with 55 novels; the <em>novela de
                                 costumbres</em>, with 50 novels; and the <em>novela social</em>,
                              with 45 novels. Smaller groups are the political novels (13), the science
                              fiction and crime novels (5 each), and the anti-slavery novels (4). The
                              latter can also be subsumed under social novels but are marked separately
                              because historically and by literary critics, they were categorized with
                              this more specific label. Twelve novels participate in other primary
                              thematic subgenres, which all occur only one to three times. The
                              classification of primary thematic subgenres is conducted for the

                              that developed in the romantic period and to the ones that literary
                              historians have often distinguished as relevant thematic subgenres in

                              accuracy of 0.80, but the results for KNN are also quite good, with a
                              mean accuracy of 0.77. The relatively high standard deviation indicates
                              that either the results vary for the different topic model parameters or
                              for the different subgenre constellations, or both. For the following,
                              more detailed analyses of the results, SVM is chosen because the standard
                              deviation is lower than for RF, even if there is only a difference of one
                              percentage point. Once the best classifier is chosen, the next step
                              consists in evaluating the feature sets in more detail. The goal is to
                              find out which influence the different parameter values have on the
                              results and to find the ones that are best suited for the classification
                              of primary thematic subgenres. The classification results for the
                              different topic modeling parameters are presented in <a href="#fig52">figure 52</a>.

                              different combinations of topic numbers and optimization intervals: with
                              60 topics and an interval of 500, 80 topics and an interval of 250, and
                              90 topics and an interval of 50, 250, or 2,500.<sup id="ftn581" class="w3-btn w3-theme-l3 w3-circle" onclick="document.getElementById('ftn581-modal').style.display='block'">581</sup> If one evaluates the general
                              development of the results for different topic numbers and optimization
                              intervals, for some intervals, there are trends, and for others,
                              oscillations. With an interval of 100, for example, the score is highest
                              at 60 topics and decreases for higher topic numbers. The score for no
                              optimization at all rises up to 70 topics and then falls again. For
                              intervals of 50 and 250, the scores get higher with more topics. Except
                              for the interval of 2,500, which means very little optimization, all the
                              scores drop with more than 90 topics. This suggests that the models get
                              too specific to detect subgenres if they have more topics. Otherwise, it
                              appears that the number of topics interacts with the optimization
                              interval so that specific combinations which produce topics and topic
                              distributions that are not too general and not too specific work well to
                              model thematic subgenres.<sup id="ftn582" class="w3-btn w3-theme-l3 w3-circle" onclick="document.getElementById('ftn582-modal').style.display='block'">582</sup></p>

                              different kinds of topic features are very low, ranging from 0.78 for 80
                              topics and an interval of 500 to the highest value of 0.81. This means
                              that the higher standard deviation observed in the general accuracy mean
                              for topic features is not due to the different topic modeling parameters
                              but must be connected to the different kinds of thematic subgenres or to
                              the influence of individual novels. With such similar results, the
                              decision to choose a certain combination of topic numbers and
                              optimization intervals does not only need to be based on the top mean
                              accuracies but can also take into account the kind of topics that are
                              likely to result from a model with a specific combination of parameters.
                              Here, 90 topics are chosen because they lead to the highest mean score
                              several times and also because the topics are more specific than they
                              would be in a topic model with a lower number of topics so that the
                              resulting text types can be described in more detail. As for the
                              optimization interval, a number of 250 is chosen so that the topics are
                              still relatively balanced regarding the different weights they have in
                              the corpus and individual texts.</p>

                              <em>novela sentimental</em> has the highest mean accuracy with
                              0.89. The second best result is reached for <em>novela histórica</em>
                              versus <em>novela de costumbres</em>, and the third for <em>novela
                                 histórica</em> versus other. This shows clearly that the historical
                              novel is the subgenre that can best be distinguished from the other two
                              thematic subgenres that were chosen here but also from the big group of
                              all other kinds of novels, which include not only sentimental novels and
                              novels of customs, but also crime novels, science fiction novels, social
                              and political novels, and more. This result confirms the expectation that
                              the <em>novela histórica</em> as a subgenre, which is by convention
                              firmly established in Argentina, Cuba, and Mexico in the nineteenth
                              century, also is united textually. Although there are different subtypes
                              of historical novels dealing with different past (or not-so-past) epochs
                              and different specific topics, the subgenre can be classified well by
                              using topic features. Furthermore, it is astonishing that it can be
                              separated best from the sentimental novel because there are many
                              historical novels with a sentimental plot and also because most
                              historical and sentimental novels in the corpus are romantic novels that
                              have much in common. This result confirms what most literary histories of
                              nineteenth-century Spanish-American novels describe (see <a href="ch3.html#ch3.1.3">chapter 3.1.3</a> on the
                              <em>novela sentimental</em>): that the sentimental novel is an
                              important and recognizable thematic subgenre as well. After the
                              historical novel, the sentimental novel has the second-best results. The
                              mean accuracy for <em>novela sentimental</em> versus other novels is
                              at 0.81, which is only slightly worse than for the historical versus the
                              other novels. Apparently, the sentimental novel can be separated well
                              from other subgenres, even if there are many novels that also have a
                              sentimental plot. However, the results also show that this is not so easy
                              if sentimental novels are compared to novels of customs. Here, the mean
                              accuracy is at 0.77, which is the worst result for the direct comparisons
                              of subgenres. This confirms what has has been remarked by Janik (<span class="w3-tooltip w3-border-bottom w3-border-blue-grey">2008, 67–68<span class="w3-text w3-tag w3-round w3-blue-grey w3-left-align w3-padding w3-large" style="position:absolute;left:0;bottom:25px">Janik, Dieter. 2008. <em>Hispanoamerikanische

                              description of local customs in novels and the expansion of the
                              <em>cuadros de costumbres</em> to longer fictional narrative works
                              in the form of novels of customs needed the sentimental plot as a basic
                              structure, at least in the romantic variant of the subgenre. The results
                              are even worse when the novels of customs are contrasted with all other
                              novels (with an accuracy of 0.71), which can be interpreted as a sign
                              that <em>costumbrista</em> elements are not only found in sentimental
                              novels but also in other subgenres. As the group of other novels also
                              contains all the social and political novels that are associated with the
                              realist (or naturalistic) current, it might well be the case that this
                              causes lower accuracy. The two results for the novels of customs can be
                              interpreted as a sign of mixtures of sentimental novels and novels of
                              customs, but also similarities of the novels of customs with other social
                              and political novels in terms of the topics that they treat. Thus, for
                              example, Kohut has noted that there are not only romantic, but also
                              realistic and naturalistic novelas de costumbres (<span class="w3-tooltip w3-border-bottom w3-border-blue-grey">Kohut 2016, 196<span class="w3-text w3-tag w3-round w3-blue-grey w3-left-align w3-padding w3-large" style="position:absolute;left:0;bottom:25px">Kohut, Karl. 2016. <em>Kurze Einführung in Theorie und

                              of over 0.70 do mean that even for the novels of customs, a model can be
                              learned that classifies the texts better than by chance, only that this
                              thematic subgenre is textually less coherent than the others. Overall,
                              the standard deviations for the accuracies (and F1-scores) are still
                              quite high, which means that the results also depend on the individual
                              novels that are selected for the training and test sets.</p>

                              that have the highest values in each subgenre constellation to inspect

                              different selections of novels and ten cross-validation runs, as

                              topic for distinguishing historical from sentimental novels is
                              “baile-salón-fiesta”, which is a topic concerned with a ball situation
                              that is typical for sentimental novels. The second&nbsp;most important
                              distinguishing topic is “sangre-voz-arma”, this time for historical
                              novels. The topic covers a situation in a fight or battle. The word
                              clouds of the two topics are given in <a href="#fig54">figure 54</a>. It is interesting that both top
                              topics describe situations that are typical for the two subgenres in
                              question and that can be considered characteristic scenes and elements of
                              the plot. As the topics consist only of nouns and verbs are not included,
                              the dynamic aspect of the topics does not stand out directly, but even
                              the nouns describe actions if they are analyzed together. In the case of
                              the ball situation, for example, the words “mirada”, “brazo”, “sonrisa”,
                              “conversación”, and “palabra” point to acts of the characters. In the
                              fight situation, also the word “brazo” occurs, as well as “cabeza”,
                              “golpe”, “grito”, “espada”, “pistola”, “puñal”, “combate”, “lucha”,
                              “herida”, and “muerte”, so in both cases parts of the body and physical
                              actions are involved. The ball topic contains also words that describe
                              the setting of the situation, for example, “salón”, “sala”, “pieza”,
                              “teatro”, “flor”, “música”, “piano”, “gente”, “reunión”, “concurrencia”,
                              “sociedad”. That the word “teatro” is part of the ball topic could be a
                              sign that similar thematic elements are relevant if the situation is a
                              theater performance as a social event. The fight topic is less
                              descriptive and contains more words related to emotions and sounds:
                              “miedo”, “peligro”, “terror”, “venganza”, “ruido”, and “silencio”.

                              are distinctive for the historical as for the sentimental novel. They
                              also alternate by importance in the range of top 0 to 25. Besides the
                              fight topic, other highly weighted topic features for the historical
                              novels are concerned with crime and prison (“crimen-cárcel-preso”),
                              politics and administration (“gobierno-pueblo-ministro”,
                              “policía-gobierno-pueblo”, “virrey-oidor-señoría”), monarchy and nobility
                              (“príncipe-rey-palacio”, “conde-condesa-señorito”), the countryside
                              (“caballo-camino-árbol”, “caballo-hacienda-compadre”), church
                              (“cura-iglesia-sacerdote”), and another topic about battles
                              (“soldado-enemigo-fuego”). These topics point to different subtypes of
                              historical novels dealing with colonial and contemporary history and
                              different urban and rural surroundings.</p>
                           
                           <p id="p692"><span class="paracount w3-blue-grey w3-margin-right"><a href="#p692">692</a></span>Among the top topics for historical novels, there is also
                              one which is a bit more difficult to interpret: “v_d-instante-corazón”.
                              It is dominated by the historical form of address “vuestra merced”, which
                              is actually not a noun but was misinterpreted by the linguistic tagger
                              because of the abbreviation “vd”. The topic, which is shown in <a href="#fig55">figure 55</a>, is a bit more
                              abstract and mixed than the other top topics for historical novels. It
                              seems to be about physical (“pecho”, “pena”, “doctor”) and mental states
                              (“alma”), feelings (“temor”, “duda”, “amor”, “placer”, “satisfacción”,
                              “esperanza”, “corazón”, “desgracia”, “felicidad”), and thoughts
                              (“pensamiento”, “idea”), but it also contains other words that are not
                              related to these aspects. The words “instante”, “puerta”, and “vista”
                              together with “fisonomía”, “cabeza”, “rostro”, “gracia”, and “virtud”
                              seem to describe a moment in which someone is observed and the appearance
                              of a person is described. The impression that this topic gives is that it
                              joins together several thematic aspects that are not prototypical for
                              historical novels but are accompanying material related to the plots and
                              the representation of the characters’ feelings.

                              for sentimental novels cover private conversation (“voz-cabeza-mirada”),
                              love (“amor-corazón-alma”, “idea-pasión-alma”), family relationships
                              (“mamá-muchacho-papá”), material aspects (“v_d-país-negocio”), interiors
                              and meals (“mesa-puerta-sala”, “mesa-copa-vino), art
                              (“poeta-maestro-artista”), and travel or movement
                              (“coche-carruaje-cochero”). The three topics “tía-do-aire”,
                              “ojos-años-manos”, and “ojos-hija-años” need a closer look. In the first
                              one, which is visualized in <a href="#fig55">figure
                                 55</a>, the word “do” sticks out because it is not a regular Spanish
                              word.<sup id="ftn585" class="w3-btn w3-theme-l3 w3-circle" onclick="document.getElementById('ftn585-modal').style.display='block'">585</sup> The novels in which this topic has the
                              highest probability were checked, and the “do” is a spelling error
                              (instead of “de”) that remained unnoticed in some of these novels.<sup id="ftn586" class="w3-btn w3-theme-l3 w3-circle" onclick="document.getElementById('ftn586-modal').style.display='block'">586</sup> Moreover, the other top words of this topic
                              suggest that it can be interpreted as being about outward appearances and
                              physical encounters because it contains words referring to people
                              (“muchacho”, “hijas”, “mujeres”, “viejita”, “virgen”), body parts
                              (“cabeza”, “ojos”, “labios”), clothes (“camisa”, “pana”, “abrigo”,
                              “alfiler”), meeting places (“sitio”, “calle”, “playa”, “pieza”, “sillas”,
                              “cama”, “flores”, “vela”), and also the word “besos” and “belleza” occur
                              in it. The word “aire” can then be read in its sense of “look” and “airs
                              and graces”. The other two topics that were not directly clear from the
                              three top words (“ojos-años-manos” and “ojos-hija-años”) can be
                              interpreted better when more of the top words are considered. The first
                              one has mixed meanings and appears more abstract than the other top
                              topics for sentimental novels. It can be described as treating views,
                              nature, body, and time. The second one is about looking, also talking,
                              mainly female persons, and emotions. In the first case, the word “años”
                              probably refers to time, and in the second case, it may refer to
                              age.<sup id="ftn587" class="w3-btn w3-theme-l3 w3-circle" onclick="document.getElementById('ftn587-modal').style.display='block'">587</sup> Summing up the findings
                              about the topics that are most important for the classifier to
                              distinguish historical from sentimental novels, it can be stated that
                              most topics can be interpreted easily from the top words and some by
                              examining them more closely. The topics of the historical novels are more
                              easily recognizable as themes, whereas some topics of the sentimental
                              novels are more subtle or mixed but also make sense for the concept of
                              the subgenre. For the aspects covered by the topics that are at first
                              sight less clear, it may have been favorable to also have verbs and
                              adjectives and not only nouns in the topics. In what follows, not all the
                              topics can be analyzed in the same depth as the ones that are most
                              distinctive for historical versus sentimental novels, and the
                              presentation of the results concentrates on the three top topic words
                              unless there are aspects that need to be clarified or are of special
                              interest. Nevertheless, a look into more top words of the topics and, if
                              needed, also into the texts of the novels shows that the topics can be
                              interpreted in more depth to characterize the subgenres that are
                              classified. The next subgenre constellation for which the feature weights
                              are analyzed is <em>novela histórica</em> versus <em>novela de
                                 costumbres</em> (see <a href="#fig56">figure
                                 56</a>).

                              distinctive for the historical novels and the negative bars to the left
                              are the ones that are distinctive for the novels of customs.
                              Interestingly, the top topic for novels of customs is the same as for
                              sentimental novels: “baile-salón-fiesta”, which shows that the text types
                              of these two kinds of conventional subgenres have common stylistic
                              traits. The top topic for the historical novels is, in this case, the
                              topic of battles: “soldado-enemigo-fuego”. The number of top topics for
                              each subgenre is less balanced in this case than for the constellation
                              <em>novela histórica</em> versus <em>novela sentimental</em>
                              because, among the top 25, there are 10 topics for the historical novels
                              and 15 for the novels of customs. This is a sign that the novels of
                              customs are more diverse in terms of characteristic topics. Besides the
                              first one, the other topics with high weights that characterize the
                              novels of customs are concerned with lower class work
                              (“muchacho-dinero-año”), with tobacco, sugar, and coffee plantations and
                              work on them (“gallo-finca-negro”, “amo-estancia-muchacho”), which
                              clearly points to the Cuban novels, with work on a ranch
                              (“cutter-indio-tierra”), which is a topic that seems to be related to
                              cattle and sheep breeding in Argentina, with the countryside
                              (“pueblo-molino-sol”, “caballo-camino-árbol”, “muchacho-año-estancia”),
                              money, business, and gambling (“dinero-fortuna-oro”), meals
                              (“mesa-copa-vino”), the description of rooms (“mesa-puerta-sala”), the
                              description of characters (“boca-cabeza-perro”), including pets (dogs and
                              cats), youth and student lifestyle (“ventana-año-piano”), and reflections
                              about society (“año-sociedad-idea”). Of these topics, the one about meals
                              was also among the top topics for sentimental novels. Furthermore, the
                              mixed topic “ojos-años-manos” about views, nature, body, and time appears
                              again. Among the top topics for the novels of customs, there are several
                              that cover rural life and surroundings, which confirms that the
                              <em>novelas de costumbres</em> were oriented towards that sphere.
                              In addition, the aspect that the life and working conditions of people
                              are realistically described in the novels of customs becomes visible in
                              the top topics. Finally, there are several descriptive topics as well as
                              a reflective one, which is in line with the aim of the novel of customs
                              to represent different areas of society closely and also to provide a
                              social critique or vision. For inspection, the two descriptive topics
                              “mesa-puerta-sala” and “boca-cabeza-perro” are given in <a href="#fig57">figure 57</a>.

                              similar to the ones that also appeared in contrasting the historical
                              novels with the sentimental ones, and they are semantically much more
                              homogeneous than the various top topics of the novels of customs. Again,
                              elements of colonial history and also contemporary politics are present.
                              A topic that is new here is, for example, “unitario-patria-cabeza”, which
                              is related to the struggle between Unitarians and Federalists that took
                              place in Argentina in the first half of the nineteenth century. The last
                              constellation of thematic subgenres for which the coefficients of the
                              linear classification model are analyzed is <em>novela de

                              Many topics that were already relevant in the other subgenre
                              constellations appear again, for example, the lower class work topic
                              “muchacho-dinero-año”, the youth and student life topic
                              “ventana-año-piano”, or the countryside topic “muchacho-año-estancia” as
                              topics that are distinctive for the novels of customs, and the love
                              topics “amor-corazón-alma” and “idea-pasión-alma”, as well as the private
                              conversation topic “voz-cabeza-mirada” as topics that are typical for the
                              sentimental novels. In addition, some new topics appear, for instance,
                              “carta-papel-duda” for the sentimental novel, which addresses the writing
                              and reading of letters, or “tío-sobrino-primo” for the novel of customs,
                              which is a topic about relatives and cliques. Furthermore, some topics
                              change the side, that is, they become distinctive for another subgenre
                              than in the other constellations that were already examined. This is the
                              case for the airs and looks topic “tía-do-aire”, which is now typical for
                              the novel of customs but was important for the recognition of sentimental
                              novels when they were contrasted with historical ones, and also for the
                              abstract views, nature, body, and time topic “ojos-años-manos”, which was
                              distinctive for novels of customs in contrast with historical novels and
                              is now typical for sentimental novels when compared to novels of customs.
                              This fluctuation shows that even though some characteristic traits of the
                              subgenres remain constant independently of the subgenre constellation,
                              others are relative and depend more on the kind of subgenres that are
                              compared. The fact that topics are, in one case, typical for the
                              sentimental novel and, in the other, for the novels of customs is again a
                              sign of how these two subgenres are intertwined thematically. That topics
                              are in one case typical for the sentimental novel and in the other for
                              the novels of customs is again a sign of how these two subgenres are
                              intertwined thematically. The plots for the constellations of the
                              individual thematic subgenres against all other novels are not shown in
                              detail here. What is interesting about them is that in all three cases,
                              there are more top topics for the positive class than for the other
                              group, which shows that the classifier focuses on the aspects that are
                              specific for the individual subgenre that is compared to the big group of
                              novels with many different subgenres, which makes complete sense.<sup id="ftn588" class="w3-btn w3-theme-l3 w3-circle" onclick="document.getElementById('ftn588-modal').style.display='block'">588</sup></p>

                              and false classifications of individual novels were analyzed for each
                              subgenre constellation, with the aim to find out how many and which of
                              the texts that are part of the conventional subgenres are typical or
                              untypical for the text types. The results of this analysis are summarized
                              in the form of histograms, which show the distributions of true
                              positives, false positives, and false negatives. The true positives are
                              interpreted as instances of the conventional genre, as well as of the
                              text type and hence of the textual genre. The false positives are
                              instances of the text type but not of the conventional and textual genre,
                              and the false negatives are part of the conventional genre but not of the
                              text type and, therefore, also not of the textual genre. For each novel
                              in the corpus, it was counted how often it fell into one of the three
                              groups in absolute and relative terms. As the data selection process was
                              random and repeated several times (ten times for the undersampling and
                              ten times for the cross-validation), not every novel of the corpus is
                              present in every classification, and some novels were classified more
                              often than others. The relative numbers of correct classifications and
                              misclassifications can still be used to examine how prototypical the
                              novels are for the subgenres. The chart for <em>novela histórica</em>

                              they mean that the novels covered by them were classified correctly or
                              wrong in many cases. In the histogram, the bars are grouped in steps of
                              10&nbsp;%, starting with 0–9&nbsp;% and ending with 90–99&nbsp;%, and then 100&nbsp;%. So the
                              rightmost group of bars stands for the novels that were classified
                              correctly or wrong in 100&nbsp;% of the cases. If the novels were classified
                              correctly, they can be interpreted as prototypical instances of the
                              subgenre. If not, there is a discrepancy between the conventional and the
                              textual genre for these novels. Of course, if a novel was only classified
                              once and then correctly, it would appear as prototypical. That
                              characterization would be less sure than for a novel that was classified
                              100 times and each time correctly, so these details have to be taken into
                              account when this kind of chart is interpreted. For the constellation
                              <em>novela histórica</em> versus other novels, 252 of the 256
                              novels in the corpus were classified at least once, among them all the 67
                              historical novels. Of these, 46 (69&nbsp;%) were classified correctly in all
                              100 classification runs and can thus be considered the prototypical core
                              of the text type <em>novela histórica</em>. Among them are, for
                              example, the romantic historical novel “La cruz y la espada” (1866, MX)
                              by Eligio Ancona and the realist historical novel “Puebla” (1903, MX) by
                              Victoriano Salado Álvarez, which both carry the explicit historical
                              subgenre label “novela histórica” and for which there is also agreement
                              among literary historians to classify them as historical novels. As an
                              example of such prototypical historical novels, the probabilities of the
                              topics that are most distinctive for historical versus other novels are

                              have for the distinction of historical and sentimental novels in general,
                              so that “baile-salón-fiesta” is the topic with the most weight and
                              “ejército-insurgente-sangre” with the least. The colors indicate for
                              which subgenre the topics are typical. The plot for “La cruz y la espada”
                              shows that several topics that are distinctive for historical novels also
                              have higher probabilities in this novel. For example, this is the case
                              for “sangre-voz-arma”, “príncipe-rey-palacio”, “conde-condesa-señorito”,
                              “cura-iglesia-sacerdote”, and “convento-fraile-sor”. Especially the last
                              four topics characterize this novel as one that is set in a more remote
                              past (it is about the Spanish conquest of Mexico) because they refer to
                              monarchy, nobility, and church. So the novel is a specific subtype of the
                              historical novel, but still always classified correctly. On the one side,
                              it has a high probability for the topic “sangre-voz-arma”, which is a
                              general topic for historical novels, but there are also top topics of
                              historical novels which are not so important in “La cruz y la espada”,
                              as, for example, “soldado-enemigo-fuego”, “virrey-oidor-señorita”,
                              “capitán-coronel-gobernador”, or “gobierno-pueblo-ministro”. The first
                              one of these is a general topic about battles. The second would be
                              typical for a novel that is set in the colonial era because it mentions
                              the viceroy and “oidor”, which was a judge in the colonial judicial
                              system. The last two would be typical for a novel that treats
                              contemporary history. This shows that the top topics of historical
                              novels, in general, combine elements of different subtypes of the
                              subgenre. As the case of “La cruz y la espada” shows, it is not necessary
                              for each individual novel to have high values for all of these topics in
                              order to be always classified correctly as a historical novel. This means
                              that not only the idea of prototypically organized categories is present
                              in the statistical classes that are determined in the machine learning
                              process, but also the idea of family resemblance: The novels can have
                              high probabilities of specific subsets of the most distinctive topics,
                              but they do not all need to have the same distributional profile.
                              However, the aspect of family resemblance that is covered by the
                              statistical classification is also limited because the boundaries between
                              classes are still strictly drawn, and there are no loose networks of
                              novels with overlapping similarities. What can be done is to interpret
                              the novels inside of a class as members of a family that share different
                              characteristics, or to analyze novels at the edges between two classes,
                              that is, novels that are often misclassified for each class, to see to
                              what extent they share properties.</p>
                           
                           <p id="p700"><span class="paracount w3-blue-grey w3-margin-right"><a href="#p700">700</a></span>In the case of “La cruz y la espada”, not only the topics
                              that are distinctive for historical novels are of interest, but also the
                              ones that are typical for other types of novels because this novel also
                              has high probabilities for some of these topics. For example, a top topic
                              that has much weight in the novel is “voz-cabeza-mirada”, and also
                              “año-sociedad-idea” and “ojos-años-manos” have higher weights. However,
                              in sum, these topics are less dominant than the ones that are typical for
                              the historical novel. What this shows is that elements that are typical
                              for other subgenres can be present and have a certain weight, but as long
                              as they are not dominating, the novel is still classified correctly. So
                              the class of a novel is really determined in quantitative terms: which
                              topics “win” in terms of numbers? This also means that a prototypical
                              historical novel can have elements of other subgenres, as well. This
                              aspect is particularly useful in the case of the nineteenth-century
                              Spanish-American historical novels, of which many were romantic and
                              included a sentimental plot or were more realistic and contained passages
                              with descriptions of customs. In this view, instances of prototypes are
                              not necessarily pure but have certain feature values and distributions
                              that are quantitatively dominating and can be interpreted as salient.</p>

                              that were always classified correctly, there are also novels that have
                              been discussed not only as historical novels but also in other terms by
                              literary historians. For example, the novel “Amalia” (1855, AR) by José
                              Mármol has been described as a political novel, a historical novel, and
                              also a sentimental novel, but is here always classified as a historical
                              novel. Regarding the historical genre conventions, an interesting aspect
                              of this novel is that the main title, “Amalia”, is typical for
                              sentimental novels because it refers to a female first name, but the
                              novel also has the subtitle “novela histórica” in most editions that are
                              published from 1874 onwards. It was therefore labeled with the primary
                              thematic label “novela histórica” here. The results of the SVM classifier
                              make clear that the sentimental plot elements do not prevent this novel
                              from being classified as a historical one. The four novels of the series
                              “Dramas militares”, which were published between 1884 and 1886 by Eduardo
                              Gutiérrez and in which the protagonist is an Argentine gaucho, are also
                              always classified as historical novels.</p>

                              thematic label “novela histórica”. One of them is “Las gentes que son así

                              was classified 39 times as a historical novel and one time as “other”, is

                              has been assigned the primary thematic label “novela de costumbres” in
                              the corpus. Already the subtitle shows that it refers to several genre
                              conventions at once. It is about banditry and has also been classified as

                              <blockquote>
                                 Manuel Payno, for example, published another serial novel
                                 <em>Los bandidos de Río Frío</em>, from 1889 to 1891. The
                                 subtitle even states that it is ‘naturalistic’, but it has much
                                 Romantic overstatement that identifies it with an earlier time.
                                 Taking the theme of banditry that had by that time become very
                                 popular, Payno wrote another essentially <em>costumbrista</em>
                                 novel.

                              probabilities that it has for the topics that are most distinctive for
                              historical novels reveals that especially the topics
                              “crimen-cárcel-preso” and “sangre-voz-arma” have high values. The first
                              one is about crime, justice, and imprisonment, and the second one is a
                              general topic about fights. These topics are not exclusively historical
                              but can as well occur in novels of other subgenres. However, because they
                              are <em>typical</em> for historical novels, the novel of customs “Las
                              gentes que son así” in which they are so important, is mistaken as a
                              historical novel, even if it does not have high probabilities for topics
                              that are more specific for historical novels, such as
                              “soldado-enemigo-fuego” or “sargente-jefe-soldados”. What this
                              demonstrates is that the classifier has no idea about the conventional
                              genres and does not make a difference between necessary, typical, or
                              sufficient features. It just compares the topic values and distributions,
                              and if it finds that they are similar to the ones typically found in a
                              certain subgenre, the novel is classified as such. The example of “Las
                              gentes que son así” is one where the novel has textual similarities to
                              historical novels and is recognized as part of the corresponding text
                              type, but it should not be treated as part of the textual genre, because
                              by convention and also in terms of necessary features it is no historical
                              novel.</p>

                              quality. The probabilities for the top topics that are typical for
                              historical novels show that some of them also have high values in this
                              novel, above all “capitán-coronel-gobernador”, “sangre-voz-arma”,
                              “crimen-cárcel-preso”, “conde-condesa-señorito”, and
                              “gobierno-pueblo-ministro”. They are more than in the novel “Las gentes
                              que son así”, and even though the general fight and crime topics appear
                              again, there are also topics concerned with the military, politics, and
                              nobility. The novel “Los bandidos de Río Frío” was published in 1892 but
                              is set in the 1830s. The male protagonist has a military position, and
                              also social and political problems of banditry, insecurity, and
                              corruption are treated in the novel. That the occupation of the
                              protagonist has an influence on the topics of the novel and that this, in
                              turn, affects how the novel is classified in terms of subgenre again
                              makes clear that a machine learning classifier cannot distinguish between
                              different reasons for which topics are present in the texts. However, the
                              combination of themes which are treated in “Los bandidos de Río Frío”,
                              together with the fact that it treats a period that is several decades
                              away from its publication time, does not make it far-fetched to compare
                              it to other novels of contemporary history, so here, the result is not
                              considered so misleading as in for “Las gentes que son así”.</p>
                           
                           <p id="p706"><span class="paracount w3-blue-grey w3-margin-right"><a href="#p706">706</a></span>The three other novels that frequently resulted as false
                              positives are “Misterios del corazón” (1875/1897, AR) by Rafael Barreda,
                              “La hija de Tutul Xiu. Novela yucateca” (1884, MX) by Eulogio Palma y
                              Palma, and “La Chapanay” (1884, AR) by Pedro Echagüe. The first one was
                              classified as a historical novel 50 out of 50 times, the second one 30
                              out of 30 times, and the third one 28 times as a historical novel and 2
                              times as “other”. Barreda’s novel has the primary label “novela
                              sentimental” and the secondary thematic label “novela histórica” because
                              it is set in the Rosas’ era. Therefore, it is not surprising that it is
                              mistaken as a historical novel, but what is surprising is that this
                              happens every time. It seems that, in this case, the setting has a bigger
                              influence on the text type than the intended primary theme of the novel.
                              Or, from another perspective, aspects of the sentimental novel are not
                              untypical for nineteenth-century Spanish-American historical novels and
                              are part of the historical novel’s text type. The case of “La hija de
                              Tutul Xiu. Novela yucateca” can also be easily explained because it is an
                              indianist novel set in the pre-Spanish period, and it also has the
                              secondary thematic label “novela histórica” in the corpus. So here, the
                              problem was that only the more specific thematic label was considered in
                              the classification and not the more general secondary one. As to “La
                              Chapanay”, it has the primary thematic label “novela de costumbres”. This
                              novel is an account of the life of Martina Chapanay, a historical
                              Argentine personality of the nineteenth century which is only of regional
                              importance. Lichtblau summarizes the novel’s contents as follows:
                              “Regional types, customs, and the daily life of the San Juaneses are
                              vividly portrayed in the novel as we see Martina first as a rebellious
                              young girl, then as a member of a band of highwaymen, and finally as a
                              contrite woman aiding the forces of law and order” (<span class="w3-tooltip w3-border-bottom w3-border-blue-grey">Lichtblau 1997, 299<span class="w3-text w3-tag w3-round w3-blue-grey w3-left-align w3-padding w3-large" style="position:absolute;left:0;bottom:25px">Lichtblau, Myron. 1997. <em>The Argentine novel: an

                              identifies it as a novel of customs, but “La Chapanay” also contains
                              passages in which the narrator expresses his political opinion and
                              criticizes the Rosas regime (<span class="w3-tooltip w3-border-bottom w3-border-blue-grey">Lichtblau 1997, 299<span class="w3-text w3-tag w3-round w3-blue-grey w3-left-align w3-padding w3-large" style="position:absolute;left:0;bottom:25px">Lichtblau, Myron. 1997. <em>The Argentine novel: an

                              “Misterios del corazón”, where it was the historical background that
                              approximated the novel stylistically to other conventional historical
                              novels, here there are argumentative passages that influence the text
                              style in terms of topics. In addition, this is another case of a hybrid
                              between the novel of customs and the historical novel.</p>
                           
                           <p id="p707"><span class="paracount w3-blue-grey w3-margin-right"><a href="#p707">707</a></span>As to the novels that were labeled as historical novels but
                              often classified as other types (the false negatives), there is none that
                              was misclassified in every run. There are three significant cases,
                              though. The first one is “Los esposos” (1893, AR) by Lola Larrosa de
                              Ansaldo, which was classified as “other” 77 times and as a historical
                              novel 23 times. In the corpus, the novel has the primary thematic label
                              “novela histórica” because it had this subtitle in the first edition. The
                              second edition, in contrast, does not have that subtitle anymore.
                              Moreover, Lichtblau describes the novel as follows: “A cloyingly romantic
                              novel, Los esposos interweaves several plots that demonstrate the
                              author’s self-righteous morality and her traditional beliefs about
                              women’s place in the home” (<span class="w3-tooltip w3-border-bottom w3-border-blue-grey">Lichtblau 1997, 530<span class="w3-text w3-tag w3-round w3-blue-grey w3-left-align w3-padding w3-large" style="position:absolute;left:0;bottom:25px">Lichtblau, Myron. 1997. <em>The Argentine novel: an

                              esposos”, which seems rather typical for a sentimental novel. In the
                              corpus, it has therefore been assigned a secondary subgenre label:
                              “novela sentimental”. As it seems, the explicit historical label that
                              this novel carries is not entirely detached from the textual material and
                              fits in 23&nbsp;% of the cases, but the novel is textually closer to another
                              subgenre, most probably the sentimental novel. A look into the weight
                              that the top distinctive topics for <em>novela histórica</em> versus
                              “other” have in this novel confirms that it does not correspond to the
                              historical novels textually (see <a href="#fig63">figure 63</a>). The topic with the highest value is
                              “voz-cabeza-mirada”, which is indeed one of the top topics for
                              sentimental novels when compared to others, but the other two topics,
                              “año-sociedad-idea” and “cuerpo-amor-ocasión”, are neither distinctive
                              for historical nor for sentimental novels, and also not for the novels of
                              customs,<sup id="ftn592" class="w3-btn w3-theme-l3 w3-circle" onclick="document.getElementById('ftn592-modal').style.display='block'">592</sup> but for other subgenres. As the novel was published in
                              1893, it is possible that it includes elements that are typical for the
                              realist or naturalist novel. The topic “año-sociedad-idea” points in the
                              first direction and “cuerpo-amor-ocasión” in the second one.

                              1910, is included in the corpus. It was classified as “other” 73 times
                              and as a historical novel 27 times. This novel is an account of the Cuban

                              series of historical novels entitled “Episodios Nacionales”. He also

                              plantations, might be an aspect that leads to the frequent
                              misclassifications in the case of “Vía Crucis”. Its top topic profile is
                              visualized in <a href="#fig64">figure 64</a>. It
                              becomes visible that this novel has high weights for topics that are
                              typical for the sentimental novel (“voz-cabeza-mirada”,
                              “baile-salón-fiesta”, and “ojos-años-manos”) and indeed a topic about
                              slavery (“esclavo-negro-amo”), but none of the topics that are
                              distinctive for novels of customs versus other novels are strong in this
                              novel. Instead, the two topics “año-sociedad-idea” and
                              “cuerpo-amor-ocasión” are important, which are the same ones as in “Los
                              esposos”. As “Vía Crucis” was published in 1910, it is a novel that is
                              clearly not a romantic historical novel and also Remos y Rubio remarks on
                              the new kind of historical novel that develops in the early twentieth
                              century and of which “Vía Crucis” is an example: “La novela histórica se
                              oscurece con el advenimiento de las nuevas tendencias, hasta que a partir
                              de 1910 la reaniman con nuevos bríos y moderna fisonomía, el selecto
                              Rodríguez Embil y el ameno narrador santiaguero, EMILIO BACARDI MOREAU”
                              (<span class="w3-tooltip w3-border-bottom w3-border-blue-grey">Remos y Rubio 1935,
                                 42<span class="w3-text w3-tag w3-round w3-blue-grey w3-left-align w3-padding w3-large" style="position:absolute;left:0;bottom:25px">Remos y Rubio, Juan J. 1935. <em>Tendencias de la

                              can also be interpreted as signs of a new type of historical novel
                              related to Realism, Naturalism, and Modernism, which is less frequent in
                              general and in the corpus than the romantic type of historical novel and
                              is therefore not recognized well, because it is not learned as part of
                              the model of the quantitatively dominant historical novel. These results
                              underline how important the construction of the corpus is for the digital
                              text analysis, and the attention to balance subparts of it. However, if a
                              certain type of novel simply was not frequent enough to be balanced
                              against another type (as the modernist historical novel, for instance,
                              against the romantic historical novel), then qualitative analysis or an
                              approach that is different from statistical classification is more
                              meaningful to describe its characteristics.

                              but is often misclassified is the novel “Las ranas pidiendo rey.
                              Confesiones de una afrancesada (1861–1862)” (1903, MX) y Victoriano
                              Salado Álvarez. It is part of the series of historical novels “Episodios
                              Nacionales Mexicanos”. The novel was classified as historical 30 times
                              and as “other” 70 times. Like “Vía Crucis”, this novel treats events of
                              the recent past. Furthermore, it is written in the form of a diary and
                              thus in the first person, which is quite unusual for a historical novel.
                              Here it is assumed that especially the latter aspect turns it into a
                              novel that is stylistically closer to other subgenres than the historical
                              novel, but the narrative perspective does not need to have much influence
                              on the topics. The plot for the novels’ top topic probabilities is given
                              in <a href="#fig65">figure 65</a> to check that.
                              What it shows is that the most important topic which is not distinctive
                              for historical novels is “año-sociedad-idea”, followed by
                              “baile-salón-fiesta”. The second one is typical for sentimental novels,
                              and it might have more weight here because of the personal account that
                              is given of the events, but not necessarily. It can also be an element
                              that is inherited from romantic historical novels with a sentimental
                              plot. The other topic about intellectual work and society is the same
                              that had much weight in “Los esposos” and “Vía Crucis”. Now, “Las ranas
                              pidiendo rey” was published in 1903, and the historical novels of
                              Victoriano Salado Álvarez are commonly attributed to the realist current.
                              So this is yet another example of a later type of historical novel that
                              challenges the classifier.

                              novel can be summarized as follows: The majority of novels are
                              prototypical historical novels and are both part of the conventional and
                              the textual genre. There are only a few novels that are consistently
                              misclassified or classified wrongly in more than 70&nbsp;% of the cases. Five
                              novels are regular false positives and interpreted as members of the text
                              type but were, for different reasons, not labeled as members of the
                              conventional genre. Three novels are persistently false negatives or
                              members of the conventional genre but not of the text type, for
                              individual reasons but also because they were published in the late
                              nineteenth or early twentieth century. In all of these cases, the results
                              can be explained by comparing and relating the textual and the
                              conventional generic levels to each other, so their misclassifications
                              are not considered real errors, except in the case of “Las gentes que son
                              así”. Howver, also in that case, the decision of the classifier can be
                              explained. Besides, there are groups of novels that are only sometimes
                              misclassified. For instance, 13 of the “novelas históricas” are
                              classified as other types only in up to 20&nbsp;% of the cases. They are still
                              considered members of the text type but less prototypical ones. On the
                              other hand, there are 38 novels of other subgenres that are classified as
                              historical novels in up to 20&nbsp;% of the cases. These are members of other
                              text types that have similarities with the historical text type and that
                              are stylistically located at the edge of the historical prototype
                              category. For the sentimental novels and the novels of customs, no
                              individual cases are discussed, but their <em>generic profiles</em>
                              are evaluated on a general level. The histograms for the constellations

                              included in the classifications for the constellation <em>novela
                                 sentimental</em> versus “other”. In total, 243 of the 256 novels
                              were part of this contrast at least once. Like the historical novel, also
                              the sentimental novel has a strong prototypical core, but it is smaller
                              than in the case of the historical novel. Of the sentimental novels, 33
                              (60&nbsp;%) were classified correctly in 100 of 100 cases, compared to 67&nbsp;% of
                              the historical novels. For the sentimental novel, there are twelve
                              instances that are regular false positives (seven with 100&nbsp;%, four with
                              90 or more, and one with 80&nbsp;%) and three instances that are very frequent
                              false negatives (one of 100&nbsp;% and the other two with 97 and 89&nbsp;%). So the
                              number of novels that were not labeled as sentimental novels but are
                              recognized as such on the textual level is higher than for the historical
                              novels, while the number of novels that carry the label but are not
                              textually congruent with the subgenre is the same. Otherwise, the
                              distribution is similar to the one of the historical novel. Less
                              prototypical are 15 novels that have the label but are not recognized as
                              sentimental novels in up to 10&nbsp;% of the classifications. At the edge of
                              the category are 34 novels that are classified as sentimental novels in
                              up to 20&nbsp;% of the cases but were not labeled as such.</p>

                              which were included in the classifications of <em>novela de
                                 costumbres</em> versus “other”. 241 novels out of the 256 in the
                              whole corpus participated in these classifications. The histogram for the
                              novel of customs looks a bit different than the ones for the historical
                              and the sentimental novel. The group of novels that are always or almost
                              always classified correctly is smaller, and there are more false
                              positives which are relatively frequent. The amount of frequent false
                              negatives, in contrast, is not especially high. This means that the
                              prototypical core of this textual genre is smaller: 20 novels (40&nbsp;%) are
                              classified correctly in 100 of 100 cases. In addition, more novels that
                              are not labeled as novels of customs still belong to the text type
                              (according to these results): 19 novels are classified as <em>novelas
                                 de costumbres</em> in 70&nbsp;% of the cases or more. On the other hand,
                              there is only one novel which is labeled as novel of customs and always
                              classified as “other”: the Cuban anti-slavery novel “El negro Francisco”
                              (1873, CU) by Antonio Zambrana y Vázquez. An interpretation of these
                              results is that the description of customs is a textual element in many
                              of the nineteenth-century Spanish-American novels. However, it is not
                              always marked on the level of historical genre convention and also not
                              always considered as the primary thematic element by literary historians
                              even if it dominates a text quantitatively. As was seen before, there are
                              many different topics that are typical for the novels of customs, which
                              might contribute to this lesser degree of overlap between the larger text
                              type and the smaller conventional genre. The results for all three
                              thematic subgenres demonstrate that the primary thematic labels that the
                              novels have are not totally disconnected from the stylistic
                              characteristics of the texts; quite the contrary. Nevertheless, there are
                              also novels in which the conventional subgenre identity does not
                              correspond to the textual one, either completely, as in the extreme
                              cases, or in part. All constellations are possible on the way from a
                              prototypical core to the edge of a textual genre, but some are more
                              frequent than others, depending on the kind of subgenre that is
                              analyzed.<sup id="ftn594" class="w3-btn w3-theme-l3 w3-circle" onclick="document.getElementById('ftn594-modal').style.display='block'">594</sup></p>

                              with MFW features and also with character n-gram features. The mean
                              accuracy for word n-grams is only 0.64. With SVM, MFW yield the best mean
                              accuracy value of 0.77, character n-grams 0.76, and the word n-grams
                              0.75, so here, the results for the three subtypes of MFW-based features
                              are very close. The RF works best with MFW features, which lead to a mean
                              accuracy of 0.78, followed by character n-grams with 0.76 and word
                              n-grams with 0.74. So MFW are the best token unit across all classifiers,
                              and character n-grams work equally well for KNN, but word n-grams work
                              less well for all three classifiers. SVM and RF are almost equally
                              successful and have the same average accuracies across the different
                              types of feature sets (MFW, word n-grams, and character n-grams). Because
                              RF is slightly better for the basic MFW, it is chosen here for evaluating
                              the classification results for primary thematic subgenres with MFW-based

                              not suited for classification by thematic subgenre. On the other hand,
                              the results stay at a high level, approximately from the 1,000 MFW
                              onwards. As was shown in the chapter on the MFW-based features, in the
                              range of 1,000 MFW, there are already verbs, adjectives, adverbs, and
                              nouns, so it can be concluded that these content words are essential for
                              the classification by thematic subgenre.<sup id="ftn598" class="w3-btn w3-theme-l3 w3-circle" onclick="document.getElementById('ftn598-modal').style.display='block'">598</sup> As to the difference between tf-idf and
                              z-scores, the former are better up to 3,000 MFW and the latter from 4,000
                              MFW onwards. When one rounds to two decimal places, the top mean
                              accuracies of 0.81 are reached with tf-idf and 3,000 or 2,000 MFW.<sup id="ftn599" class="w3-btn w3-theme-l3 w3-circle" onclick="document.getElementById('ftn599-modal').style.display='block'">599</sup>

                              3-grams or 4-grams, which was expected because the more words are
                              involved, the less frequent the combinations are in the corpus and
                              potentially less helpful to classify texts by genre if they only occur in
                              a few texts. Here, too, the results are generally better from 1,000 MFW
                              onwards than with fewer MFW, but they also drop again for the 2-grams and
                              4-grams, even if slowly. The differences between tf-idf values and
                              z-scores are very small. The best mean accuracy is achieved with tf-idf,
                              word 2-grams, and 2,000 MFW, which is at 0.79. If the values are rounded
                              to two decimal points, the same result is achieved with 2-grams from
                              1,000 to 4,000 MFW with both tf-idf and z-scores, and also with 5,000 MFW
                              and z-scores, so the differences between these different constellations
                              are minimal.</p>

                              of 0.80 are achieved with character 5-grams and tf-idf values for several
                              numbers of MFW (1,000 to 5,000, with accuracies rounded to two decimal

                              it can be observed that the top mean accuracies are all very similar, as
                              they range from 0.79 in the case of word 2-grams over 0.80 for the
                              character n-grams to 0.81 for normal MFW. All of these token units seem
                              equally suited to classify the novels by thematic subgenres. As to the
                              numbers of MFW, higher numbers of 1,000 or more tokens work better in all
                              cases. Regarding the normalization techniques, tf-idf was, in general,
                              the one that reached the top values, but the differences between the
                              different maximum mean accuracies were small in many cases. Only the

                              a mean accuracy of 0.90, the second best <em>novela histórica</em>
                              versus <em>novela de costumbres</em> with 0.88, and the third best
                              <em>novela histórica</em> versus “other” with 0.86. Again, the
                              historical novel is the subgenre that can be separated best from the
                              other thematic subgenres, followed by the sentimental novel. For the
                              latter, a score of 0.78 is achieved if the subgenre is compared to all
                              other novels and a score of 0.74 if it is contrasted with the novel of
                              customs. As with the topics, also with MFW, the <em>novelas de
                                 costumbres</em> have the lowest mean accuracy of all constellations
                              when they are classified against all other novels. In part, it is
                              understandable that 3,000 MFW leads to similar results as topics because
                              content words and, thereby, semantic features which can capture thematic
                              elements or other semantic surface structures are also part of this
                              feature set. Nevertheless, in the MFW set, not only nouns are included,
                              but all kinds of word categories, and there is no layer of hidden
                              semantic distributions that is analyzed, but the (normalized) word
                              frequencies are directly used as features. So obtaining such similar
                              classification results with different feature sets means that the results
                              are meaningful regarding the characteristics of the different
                              subgenres.</p>

                              classification of thematic subgenres is that the standard deviations were
                              not reduced considerably from the first average results based on all
                              feature sets and parameter constellations to the individual subgenre
                              constellations. They were about 0.15 in the first overviews and are still
                              at about 0.10 in the direct comparison of subgenres with a certain
                              feature set. This means that approximately two-thirds of the variation
                              are to due to different selections of novels for the various
                              classification runs, which shows how important it is to have a corpus and
                              subcorpora for the different subgenres as large as possible and how
                              important it is to prevent the classifiers from focusing too much on
                              specific novels. Furthermore, it means that in the case of the
                              nineteenth-century Spanish America novels analyzed here, the thematic
                              subgenres are not categories of very homogeneous texts but of texts that
                              share textual features so that they are recognizable as instances of the
                              text types, but they do so to different degrees. Furthermore, that the
                              results for different classifiers, feature sets, and feature parameters
                              are so similar indicates that the approximately 20&nbsp;% of accuracy that is
                              missing to reach the perfect classification is probably not due to a
                              wrong choice of features or settings in the classification procedure but
                              due to the discrepancies between the conventional genres and their text
                              types. This could also be shown in the discussion of examples of
                              historical novels that were frequently misclassified.</p>

                              currents has several purposes. As for the thematic subgenres, the results
                              of the classification are analyzed to see which classifiers and feature
                              sets work best to capture the differences between the various literary
                              currents. The best constellations are then chosen to see how well the
                              different constellations of literary currents can be classified. A short
                              analysis of the features that are decisive in the classification as well
                              as overviews of how often individual novels were classified correctly or
                              wrong is given for the MFW-based features in this case but not for the
                              topics. Word-based features are considered more interesting for the
                              literary currents because they are not primarily thematically defined,
                              even if ranges of different topics are also characteristic for them. For
                              the literary currents, style in a narrower sense is assumed to play a

                              also RF follow closely with 0.83 each. These mean accuracies are higher
                              than the ones for the thematic subgenres, which were 0.77 and 0.80 for
                              topic features. This was not expected for the topic features because
                              especially the novels of the romantic current are subdivided into
                              specific thematic subgenres. Apparently, despite the different
                              conventional and textual thematic subgenres, the romantic novels all have
                              topics in common when contrasted with novels of the two later realist and
                              naturalistic currents. The possibility that the topics are not thematic
                              in a narrow sense also has to be kept in mind because they can also
                              represent other structures (descriptions, argumentation, motifs, etc.).
                              That so high results are already reached on average for all kinds of
                              features and subgenre constellations demonstrates that the literary
                              currents were not merely conventional movements but that the novels
                              associated with them had textual and stylistic traits in common. The next
                              step consists in evaluating which feature parameters worked best with the
                              SVM classifier.&nbsp;An overview of the results for different numbers of
                              topics and optimization intervals is given in <a href="#fig74">figure 74</a>.

                              the differences are small between the different parameter constellations.
                              The top mean accuracies are reached with 70 topics and an optimization
                              interval of 1,000 and with 90 topics and an interval of 2,500.<sup id="ftn608" class="w3-btn w3-theme-l3 w3-circle" onclick="document.getElementById('ftn608-modal').style.display='block'">608</sup> Regarding the developments of different optimization
                              intervals with an increasing number of topics, the curves for intervals
                              of 50, 100, and 250 first fluctuate and then rise from 80 topics onwards.
                              Intervals of 500 and 5,000 have downward trends, the curves of 1,000 and
                              2,500 mainly fluctuate but also fall with more topics, and the curve for
                              no optimization at all is the most stable one. Here, the best combination
                              of 90 topics and an optimization interval of 2,500 is chosen to analyze
                              the classification results for literary currents further. That a
                              constellation with less hyperparameter optimization works better for the
                              literary currents than for the thematic subgenres is a sign that it is
                              helpful if the topics are more evenly distributed across the corpus and
                              in the individual novels, maybe because the literary currents are more
                              general phenomena than the thematic subgenres.</p>

                              clear differences as to how well the different literary currents can be
                              distinguished from each other. The best mean accuracy of 0.92 is achieved
                              for the classification of the <em>novela romántica</em> versus other
                              novels and the <em>novela romántica</em> versus the <em>novela
                                 naturalista</em>. That the latter constellation yields the best
                              results could be expected because the naturalistic novel can be
                              considered a further development and specialization of the realist novel,
                              carrying the realist aesthetic to the extreme so that it is also
                              poetically more distant from the romantic novel. The best result for the
                              <em>novela romántica</em> versus other novels with 0.92 and also
                              the third best one for the <em>novela romántica</em> versus the
                              <em>novela realista</em> with a mean accuracy of 0.91 was not
                              expected for several reasons: because of the smooth transition of
                              Romanticism into Realism in Spanish America, the existence of several
                              novels that combine elements of both currents and the novels that
                              included realistic elements before Realism (in particular the novels of
                              customs). Furthermore, the romantic novel included several thematic
                              subgenres, each of which is recognizable by its own topics, as was seen
                              in the previous chapter. As it seems, the difference between romantic and
                              realist novels is still big enough to lead to such good classification
                              results. The classification of naturalistic novels against all others
                              achieves a mean accuracy of 0.85, the realist novel versus the others
                              0.80, and the realist versus the naturalistic novels 0.77. That the score
                              is lowest for the <em>novela realista</em> versus the <em>novela
                                 naturalista</em> could be expected because of the temporal overlap
                              of both literary currents in nineteenth-century Spanish America but also
                              because of the similar aesthetic concept of these two currents. The
                              realist novel can be interpreted as the current that has a middle
                              position between the romantic and the naturalistic novel. Therefore, it
                              is not surprising that it has the lowest mean accuracy when it is
                              contrasted with all the other romantic and naturalistic works. Next, the
                              results achieved with MFW-based features and the different classifiers
                              are analyzed for the literary currents. An overview of the results for

                              classifier achieved the best results with a mean accuracy of 0.86 for the
                              basic MFW. The second-best mean accuracy is 0.84 for RF, and the worst is
                              0.78 for KNN. For all three classifiers, word n-gram features produced
                              worse results than single words. For KNN, the best results were achieved
                              with the character n-grams, and for SVM and RF, with words. As the SVM
                              classifier worked best, it was chosen to further evaluate the results.
                              The mean accuracies for different values of MFW and the three

                              0.88 is reached with 3,000 MFW and tf-idf values. The differences between
                              tf, tf-idf, and z-scores are minimal. The mean accuracies for the other
                              numbers of MFW from 1,000 up to 5,000 are also at 0.87 or 0.88 if the
                              values are rounded to two decimal points. So the most important aspect is
                              to use 1,000 MFW as a minimum, which was also the case for the thematic
                              subgenres. As 3,000 MFW and tf-idf resulted in the highest mean accuracy,
                              that combination of parameters was kept for the analysis of further
                              results. <a href="#fig76">Figure 76</a>&nbsp;visualizes

                              thematic subgenres in that word 2-grams produce better results than word
                              3-grams or 4-grams. Here, too, the best mean accuracy of 0.87 is reached
                              with 3,000 MFW for tf-idf and also for z-scores. As for word features,
                              also for word n-grams, the results get much better with 1,000 MFW or
                              more. It is of interest that the word 2-grams are almost as good as the
                              word features which reached 0.88 because interpreting word 2-gram
                              features might reveal further relevant aspects about the subgenres. Next,

                              0.86 is achieved with character 4-grams, 4,000 MFW, and tf-idf, so it is
                              slightly worse than for word 2-grams or basic MFW. Other n-gram units
                              lead to very similar results, but interestingly, with more than 3,000
                              MFW, the scores drop a bit for character 3-grams but rise for the 4-grams
                              and also the 5-grams. As more content words are included with higher
                              numbers of MFW, maybe it is advantageous for the classification of
                              subgenres when a bigger part of these words is captured with the larger
                              character n-grams. In contrast to word units or word 2-grams, the results
                              for character n-grams already stabilize largely with 500 MFW. The results
                              for the special n-gram type “word”, which only contains character n-grams
                              from the inside of words and n-grams that include the end of one word and
                              the beginning of another, are shown in <a href="#fig78">figure 78</a>.

                              MFW, character 4-grams, and tf-idf values or z-scores. This is higher
                              than for the normal character n-grams, but this special character n-gram
                              type does not outperform other feature types completely because it is
                              equal to the highest score that was achieved with basic MFW. The other
                              special n-gram type, “affix-punct”, which only includes prefixes, (i.e.,
                              word beginnings), and punctuation marks, yields 0.87 as the best score.
                              The same is achieved with character 4-grams, this time with 2,000 MFW and

                              naturalistic novel versus the other novels. Compared to the topic
                              features, here, all values are higher except the ones involving the
                              naturalistic novel. This result is intriguing because it seems that the
                              naturalistic novel is better captured with features related to themes
                              than with word features. The change goes in the other direction for the
                              realist novel. Here, the contrast between the <em>novela
                                 realista</em> versus the other novels is 7 % higher than with topic
                              features, and the opposition of the <em>novela realista</em> and the
                              <em>novela naturalista</em> is 9&nbsp;% higher here than with topic
                              features. The <em>novela romántica</em> versus the <em>novela
                                 realista</em> is only 1&nbsp;% better with MFW than with topic features,
                              though. So the realist novel wins if word features are used instead of
                              topics. The result is so interesting because the label “novela
                              naturalista” is used in subtitles of several novels in the corpus. In
                              addition, its status as a (thematic) subgenre versus a literary current
                              or movement has been discussed, for example, by Schlickers, who confirms
                              that the naturalistic novel was a concept that was consciously applied
                              and communicated by contemporary writers in the nineteenth century.<sup id="ftn610" class="w3-btn w3-theme-l3 w3-circle" onclick="document.getElementById('ftn610-modal').style.display='block'">610</sup></p>

                              are on the left side and the ones for the romantic novels on the right
                              side. Among the top 25 features, there are 17 which are important for the
                              realist novel and only 8 for the romantic novel, which is a sign that the
                              realist novel is stylistically more homogeneous than the romantic novel.
                              Among the top words for realist novels, there are several adjectives, of
                              which the most important one is “rojo”. The others are “duro”, “gran”,
                              “duros”, “excelente”, and “listo”. In the list of the romantic novels,
                              there is no adjective. A more frequent use of adjectives could be due to
                              more descriptive passages in the realist novels. Nouns, too, are only
                              present in the list for realist novels: “corriente”, “grupo”, “política”,
                              “envidia”, “hoja”, “importancia”. So politics is an important topic in
                              realist novels. Groups of people are also relevant, and “envy” points to
                              their materialist orientation. The other three nouns are not so easily
                              interpreted at first sight. Furthermore, there are some verbs in the past
                              tense: “mostraba”, “habló”, and “escribió”. The last one, together with
                              “hoja”, seems to indicate that people frequently write things down in
                              realist novels. The words that are distinctive for the romantic novel
                              include the first person plural verb form “hemos”, the participle
                              “quedado”, the adverbs “verdaderamente” and “entonces”, the demonstrative
                              pronouns “esta” and “este”, and the adjective “solo”. The fact that the
                              word “lonely” is typical for the romantic novel fits well with the
                              concept of the individual romantic hero or heroine. Furthermore, it is
                              noticeable that the words with the top weights for the two different
                              literary currents belong to different grammatical categories. The feature
                              importances of the naturalistic versus realist novel are shown in <a href="#fig81">figure 81</a>.

                              novels are on the left side, and the ones that are typical for the
                              realist novels are on the right. Again, the proportion of top features is
                              8:17, with more features for the realist novels. The nouns that are
                              typical for the naturalistic novels are “mitad” &nbsp;and “pasajeros”. The
                              first one is an indication of quantity. The passengers could either be
                              connected to transport in a city or to travel. The word “costado” is here
                              probably the participle “cost” and not the noun “side” and alludes to the
                              importance of money in naturalistic novels. The adverbs “hasta” and
                              “recién” indicate that time also matters in novels of this literary
                              current. The verb “convencer” is the only infinitive in the whole list.
                              To convince someone means the need to discuss and the will to achieve a
                              certain goal. The words “cual” and “fuesen” are not easily interpreted.
                              As to the words that are distinctive for the realist novels, there are
                              some which did already appear in contrast with the romantic novels.
                              Again, there are several verbs in the past tense: “traía”, “dieron”, and
                              “oyeron”. The nouns “figura”, “gracia”, and “voces” are new. The verbs in
                              past tense could mean that narrative passages in which the actions of
                              characters are described are more frequent in realist novels than in
                              romantic and naturalistic ones. Altogether, the MFW features that are
                              weighted highly by the SVM classifier can be interpreted well as
                              stylistic cues of the literary currents in the same way as the topic
                              features could be explained for the thematic subgenres. To conclude the
                              discussion of the classification results for literary currents, the
                              <em>classification profiles</em> with the proportions of true
                              positives, false positives, and false negatives are visualized in figures
                              <a href="#fig82">82</a>&nbsp;to <a href="#fig84">84</a>. On the one hand, they serve to see how many
                              novels were always classified correctly and are part of the conventional
                              as well as the textual genres. On the other hand, it is checked whether
                              there are any cases of novels that are misclassified very frequently and
                              are only part of either the text type or the conventional genre.

                              are false positives or false negatives in more than 20&nbsp;% of the cases for
                              none of the literary currents. This was very different for the thematic
                              subgenres. It means that there are more considerable discrepancies
                              between the conventional genres and the text types for the thematic
                              subgenres than for the literary currents. A hypothesis is that the
                              literary currents that the novels belong to are mostly determined by
                              literary historians. Therefore, they could be closer to the textual
                              characteristics of the texts than, for example, explicit historical
                              labels of thematic subgenres that might be misleading. Another hypothesis
                              is that the style of novels that are part of a certain literary current
                              is easier to recognize than the primary theme of a novel. At least in
                              some cases of the novels, there are diverging opinions also among
                              literary historians about which primary topic they have. Furthermore, the
                              primary themes of the novels are not necessarily congruent with the
                              surface topics, which can lead to misclassifications. All in all, the
                              classification results for the literary currents showed that these are
                              indeed categories with a stylistic unity.</p>

                           to categorize the novels by subgenre. Overall, high accuracy values of 70&nbsp;%
                           and more could be achieved when the classifiers tried to recognize which
                           texts match which subgenre labels, so the congruence of the conventional
                           genres and text types is relatively high. Furthermore, the analysis of
                           misclassified examples showed that there are individual cases of less
                           prototypical works or special cases in which the conventional label of a
                           novel does not correspond so well to its textual and stylistic
                           characteristics. As classification <em>aims</em> to match labels and
                           texts, it might cover internal differentiations of the text types. The
                           limits between the different classes are strictly drawn, and the connections
                           that can exist between individual novels or groups of novels that are part
                           of different conventional subgenres are cut off. Therefore, a method relying
                           on network analysis is proposed here as a “family resemblance analysis” with
                           the aim of providing a more open means of categorization. It is very likely
                           that the groups of novels found by this approach are influenced by a number
                           of different factors that determine the style of the texts, such as
                           authorship, period, or narrative perspective. This is not viewed as a
                           principal drawback because such factors are the ones that contribute to the
                           organic whole of the subgenres’ style if the subgenres are understood as
                           groups of historical texts set in a specific geographical, cultural, and
                           temporal context and as texts written by individual authors who shape the
                           subgenres through their works. They are only disturbing if they dominate the
                           categorization completely so that the groupings are no longer about
                           subgenres as the target of the stylistic analysis but about some other
                           factor.</p>
                        
                        <p id="p743"><span class="paracount w3-blue-grey w3-margin-right"><a href="#p743">743</a></span>In the previous chapter, it was shown that even the results of
                           classification could be interpreted in terms of prototypical structures and
                           family resemblance. However, in classification, the similarity between
                           different texts is still determined based on whole feature distributions and
                           not of overlapping parts of it. Even if it is enough for a historical novel
                           to have high weights for some topics that are distinctive for historical
                           novels in order to be classified as such, it is not possible in standard
                           classification that a novel is grouped with novels of one subgenre based on
                           some topics and categorized with novels of another subgenre based on other
                           topics that it has – a decision for one class is always made. Even with
                           multilabel classification, an approach where each sample can be recognized
                           as an instance of several different classes, the assignments are made based
                           on internal comparisons of two classes, and it is decided in each case if
                           the sample is a member of the positive or the negative class. In the
                           network-based family resemblance analysis, in contrast, links between
                           individual novels are decisive. If a group of several novels turns out to
                           have particularly strong links, they are considered members of one category.
                           However, each member still also has links with other novels outside of the
                           “nuclear family”. Furthermore, the similarities are determined for each pair
                           of novels and not for one novel against all others in the group so that
                           partial similarities, understood as individual resemblances, can hold the
                           group together.</p>
                        
                        <p id="p744"><span class="paracount w3-blue-grey w3-margin-right"><a href="#p744">744</a></span>Regarding the analysis of the subgenres, the family
                           resemblance analysis has several functions. It can serve to find out how a
                           subgenre is organized internally: by looking at the network of similarities
                           between the individual novels, do subgroups, i.e. individual
                           <em>families</em>, emerge, and which traits hold them together? Can
                           the prospectively historical novels, for example, be distinguished from the
                           other novels belonging to that subgenre, or the romantic historical novels
                           from the realist and modernist ones? Or are there differences by country or
                           over time? As can be seen, no preliminary assumption is made here as to the
                           kind of connections that the family resemblance analysis might reveal for
                           the internal structure of subgenres. There can be diachronic shifts but also
                           synchronic variations in the subgenres. Another possibility is to analyze
                           novels of several subgenres or the whole corpus of novels together to see
                           how they are connected stylistically when no strict boundaries are applied.
                           That way, it can be tested whether pure or mixed types of subgenres become
                           visible as <em>families</em>. It is useful to test the feature sets with
                           classification beforehand to make it probable that the textual features used
                           are relevant for the distinction of subgenres at all. Here, topics are used
                           as features, for which it was shown in the previous chapter that they work
                           well to classify nineteenth-century Spanish-American novels by subgenre. In
                           particular, the historical novel and the sentimental novel are examined,
                           with a focus on the historical novel, to analyze the internal substructure
                           of these subgenres. In a third network, historical and sentimental novels
                           are compared. In the following, first, the method for the creation of the
                           family resemblance network is outlined. Then the subcorpus of novels that
                           was used for the family resemblance analyses is presented, and the resulting
                           networks are discussed.</p>

                              first, the similarities between all the individual novels were calculated
                              for the chosen feature set using cosine similarity.<sup id="ftn611" class="w3-btn w3-theme-l3 w3-circle" onclick="document.getElementById('ftn611-modal').style.display='block'">611</sup> After that, the resulting textual similarities
                              were mapped onto a network structure. The novels themselves constitute
                              the nodes in the network. The network relationships (or edges) were
                              determined using the three nearest neighbors of each text, which were
                              selected from a ranking of the text similarities. The strength (or
                              weight) of the edges was calculated by summing up the similarity values
                              of the neighbors.<sup id="ftn612" class="w3-btn w3-theme-l3 w3-circle" onclick="document.getElementById('ftn612-modal').style.display='block'">612</sup></p>

                              between all the texts. Reducing the number of connections for the network
                              to the three nearest neighbors makes the network less complex and the
                              closest relationships in it more salient. This, in turn, enhances the
                              interpretability of the network. The choice of three is arbitrary and
                              could be varied. However, using more than one nearest neighbor makes the
                              results of the network more stable, as Eder has shown (<span class="w3-tooltip w3-border-bottom w3-border-blue-grey">Eder 2017, 56–60<span class="w3-text w3-tag w3-round w3-blue-grey w3-left-align w3-padding w3-large" style="position:absolute;left:0;bottom:25px">Eder, Maciej. 2017. “Visualization in stylometry: Cluster

                              stylometric cluster analysis more reliable. This technique is adapted
                              here with a different aim: to formalize the family resemblance concept
                              for genre analysis.</p>

                              community detection was used to explore the <em>families</em> of
                              novels in the network. Communities are sets of nodes in a network that
                              are more densely connected to each other than to nodes outside.<sup id="ftn613" class="w3-btn w3-theme-l3 w3-circle" onclick="document.getElementById('ftn613-modal').style.display='block'">613</sup> Different algorithms for the detection of
                              network communities exist.<sup id="ftn614" class="w3-btn w3-theme-l3 w3-circle" onclick="document.getElementById('ftn614-modal').style.display='block'">614</sup>
                              Here, the Louvain modularity algorithm was used. It is based on
                              modularity optimization, which means that possible divisions of the
                              network are checked and optimized to reach high modularity so that the
                              nodes which share a community are more likely to be connected with each
                              other than with other nodes that are not community members. The Louvain
                              algorithm optimizes local communities iteratively until the best global
                              modularity of the network is reached. Here, non-overlapping communities
                              are built, meaning that each node is only part of one community in the
                              result. As it looks for densely connected data points, the Louvain
                              algorithm is suitable to detect <em>families</em> of novels. To that
                              end, the novels are represented as vectors in a space of textual
                              features, in which they can be closer to each other or further away, and
                              these similarities (or distances) are interpreted in terms of network
                              links. Furthermore, the algorithm is also comparatively efficient and has
                              been implemented in Python, which is used to create and visualize the
                              network here.<sup id="ftn615" class="w3-btn w3-theme-l3 w3-circle" onclick="document.getElementById('ftn615-modal').style.display='block'">615</sup></p>

                              formulated by Wittgenstein and in literary genre theory and how it is
                              implemented here, the following observations can be made. Using
                              similarity relationships between novels based on feature distributions
                              means that not the presence or absence of a trait or a set of traits
                              determines the connection between members of a family and the difference
                              to other families, but the numerical strengths of the features in
                              combination and this only between pairs of individual novels.<sup id="ftn616" class="w3-btn w3-theme-l3 w3-circle" onclick="document.getElementById('ftn616-modal').style.display='block'">616</sup> The similarities of the various
                              pairs are summed up and interpreted in terms of neighbor rankings to
                              build the families. This transfers the idea of partial and overlapping
                              similarities to a quantitative approach because nearest neighborship
                              between novel A and another novel B, on the one hand, and novel B and C,
                              on the other, does not mean that A and C must also be closest in a direct
                              comparison.</p>

                              families, the boundaries of the categories are retroactively sharpened
                              because communities are clusters, which have members and non-members.
                              This is an advantage that balances out the looseness of the original
                              family resemblance concept. However, there is a significant difference
                              between these &nbsp;communities and classes in a logical sense because the
                              former emerge from a network of similarities and not from the condition
                              of shared common features. The communities mark a boundary between one
                              group of dense relationships and another, they cut off the family at a
                              certain point but they do not lever out the basic idea of family
                              resemblance, because the links to other families and family members in

                              the top 40 words of four of the resulting 100 topics are visualized. They
                              exemplify the range of themes covered in the novels. The first topic is
                              about love and feelings (“amor”, “corazón”, “alma”, “amor”, “pasión”);
                              the second topic is dominated by politics (“gobierno”, “ministro”,
                              “guerra”, “poder”), the third one is about crime and banditry (“bandido”,
                              “jefe”, “ladrón”, “robo”), and the fourth one about religion and
                              colonization (“sacerdote”, “dios”, “español”, “guerrero”). The first
                              number in parentheses indicates the rank of the topic by its probability
                              in the whole corpus, so the topics are of different importance for the
                              whole collection of texts. The lower the topic rank, the more important
                              the topic is, so the love topic is a very general one, the politics and
                              crime topics are still rather common, and the colonization topic is more
                              special.</p>

                              is which kinds of novels constitute the different <em>families</em>.
                              Before looking at different clusters in detail, an overview of the
                              cluster sizes was generated, and the possible influence of some
                              text-external and -internal factors on the clusters was calculated, as
                              displayed in figures <a href="#fig88">88</a>&nbsp;and
                              <a href="#fig89">89</a>.

                              novels each, and the other two are smaller. Cuban novels are only
                              contained in clusters 1, 2, 3, and 5. Clusters 1, 4, and 5 are dominated
                              by Mexican novels and clusters 2 and 3 by Argentine novels. Cluster 3 is
                              an Argentine-Cuban cluster, and cluster 5 is a Mexican-Cuban cluster.
                              Even if there are some tendencies regarding the distribution of novels by
                              country in the different clusters, there is no cluster consisting only of
                              novels from one country, and it should also be kept in mind that the
                              overall number of novels in the individual clusters is quite small. The
                              narrative perspective is not significant for the historical novels
                              because there is only one novel with a homodiegetic narrator, the others
                              all have a heterodiegetic narrator. The five historical novels written by
                              female authors are distributed over the three clusters 2, 3, and 4, so
                              there is no clear female cluster. Regarding the distribution of the
                              novels over the years, there is also much overlap, as all the clusters
                              have earlier and later novels. Apart from one outlier, cluster 2 is
                              rather late, and cluster 4 is mostly filled with earlier works.

                              retrace the family resemblance relationships. In <a href="#tab45">table 45</a>, the novels contained in cluster 3 are
                              listed together with their nearest neighbors (N-1, N-2, N-3), including
                              the weight of the edge to the respective neighbor. The strongest
                              relationship exists between “La novela de la sangre” (1903, AR) by Carlos
                              Octavio Bunge and “Los misterios del Plata” (1868, AR) by Juana Manso de
                              Noronha because they are mutually closest to each other. Other bilateral
                              nearest neighborships between novels in the cluster are highlighted in
                              lighter orange. The novel “Pepa Larrica” (1884, AR) by Rafael Barreda has
                              two nearest neighbors in the cluster, but the relationships are only
                              unilateral. Boxes that are not highlighted show which nearest neighbors
                              are outside of the current cluster. It becomes clear that some novels are
                              central members of the <em>family</em> while others are rather
                              distant relatives.

                              topics.<sup id="ftn622" class="w3-btn w3-theme-l3 w3-circle" onclick="document.getElementById('ftn622-modal').style.display='block'">622</sup> In
                              addition to the lines for the five novels in the cluster, a black dashed
                              line indicating the mean topic values for all the historical novels in
                              the network is added. The topics are ordered by importance in the whole
                              corpus of 256 novels from top to bottom so that more general topics are
                              at the top and more special topics are further down. Some topics of
                              interest are labeled, the black ones being particularly important for
                              this cluster and the red ones less important when compared to all the
                              historical novels in the corpus. What makes the family approach visible
                              is that not all the decisive topics are equally relevant for the
                              individual novels in the cluster. For example, the topics
                              “sacerdote-dios-español” and “fortaleza-batería-plaza” are
                              underrepresented in the whole cluster, but “amor-corazón-alma” and
                              “soldado-fuego-columna” are only partly less relevant. The first
                              corresponds to the mean for the novel “Amalia” and the second reaches
                              almost the mean for “Vía Crucis”. Topics that are overrepresented in
                              several novels in the cluster are “voz-palabra-brazo”,
                              “idea-espíritu-instante”, “pueblo-ley-país”, “calle-puerta-voz”,
                              “agua-cuerpo-sangre”, “gobierno-ministro-guerra”,
                              “puerta-espíritu-cabeza”, and “cabeza-rosa-asesino”. They stand for the
                              general characteristics of the family: historical novels that are not so
                              much mixed with love stories, not focused on military actions and not
                              about the Conquest or colonial history, but about political ideas and
                              conditions, and about (inter)personal contacts and states, about voices,
                              words, and bodies. However, as specific topic values are not necessary
                              conditions, some of the novels have their own special topics. The topic
                              “mar-buque-puerto” is specific for “Los misterios del Plata”,
                              “negro-esclavo-amo” &nbsp;for “Vía Crucis”, the only Cuban novel in this

                              for the different clusters in the network of historical novels is given
                              in <a href="#fig91">figure 91</a>. In the heatmap,
                              the yellower the boxes, the more important the topics are for the

                              distinctiveness was calculated by normalizing the topic values to
                              z-scores. Here, only the top 30 most distinctive topics are shown. The
                              values in parentheses at the end of the topic labels indicate the ranks
                              of the topics in the whole corpus, so the topic “voz-palabra-brazo”, for
                              example, is much more general than “fortaleza-batería-plaza”.

                              discussed can be recognized in the heatmap. The smallest cluster 0 seems
                              to be about the Conquest and colonial history, as the most distinctive
                              topics are concerned with Indians and Spaniards (“indio-español-tierra”),
                              rural church (“cura-fraile-pueblo”), and seafaring (“mar-buque-puerto”).
                              In Cluster 1, topics about military campaigns and rural life prevail,
                              making one think about internal struggle, bandits, and gauchos. The
                              topics that are distinctive for this cluster are about conversation and
                              social roles of bandits (“palabra-asunto-razón”, “bandido-jefe-razón”,
                              “bandido-jefe-ladrón”), provincial police forces
                              (“cabellero-comisario-provincia”), horses (“caballo-amo-instante”),
                              soldiers and military actions (“manera-soldado-muerte”,
                              “ejército-prisionero-jefe”), and ranches (“hacienda-compadre-pueblo”).
                              Cluster 2 is not so easy to interpret. It is also about military action
                              (“soldado-fuego-columna”, “sargento-cerro-gruta”, and
                              “ejército-guerra-ciudad”), but there are other, individual topics.
                              Cluster 4 is clearly romantic, as it contains topics about love
                              (“corazón-alma-lágrima”, “amor-corazón-alma”), about the missionary work,
                              colonial administration and aristocracy (“sacerdote-dios-español”,
                              “alcalde-dama-barón”), and illness (“instante-doctor-sitio”). This fits
                              well with the observation that it contains mostly earlier novels. The
                              last cluster is politico-historical with top topics about the military
                              (“soldado-jefe-coronel”, “fortaleza-batería-plaza”), government
                              (“gobierno-ministro-guerra”), and the time of the French intervention in
                              Mexico (“francés-emperador-estudiante”).</p>

                              one containing both types of subgenres are only summarized briefly here.
                              Regarding the metadata, the cluster sizes vary more for the sentimental
                              novels.The biggest cluster has 14 novels, and the smallest one has only
                              two. All the clusters are mixed by country. Among the sentimental novels,
                              there are more with an autodiegetic and a homodiegetic narrator, and the
                              narrative perspective has an influence on the results. The smallest
                              cluster, for instance, consists solely of autodiegetic texts featuring
                              topics related to inner life and landscape. For the sentimental novels,
                              there are also clearer tendencies of topic changes over time, as <a href="#fig92">figure 92</a> shows. The early
                              cluster 0 is romantic with letters, dance, aristocracy, and much
                              emotionality. The three later clusters are the ones dominated by
                              interiorization, and the mid-century cluster 5 is worldly about food,
                              marriage, business, and money.

                              neatly sorted into different <em>families</em>. As can be seen in
                              <a href="#fig93">figure 93</a>, there are
                              clusters dominated by one subgenre – clusters 1, 3, and 6 by sentimental
                              novels and clusters 2, 4, and 7 by historical novels – but there is no
                              cluster containing only novels of one subgenre and the clusters 0 and 5
                              are entirely mixed. In the combined network, the cluster sizes vary
                              moderately from 7 to 13 novels. Here, too, there is no clear tendency for
                              countries. Different narrative perspectives are not concentrated in
                              single clusters, so this aspect observed for the sentimental novels alone
                              disappears when they are analyzed in the more general setup. Regarding
                              the distribution by years, cluster 1 is early, clusters 3, 4, and 6 are
                              late, and the others are mixed. The topics that are distinctive for the
                              different <em>families</em> reflect the relative purity or mixture of
                              subgenres as well as the preferences of the early versus late nineteenth
                              century.

                              nineteenth-century Spanish-American historical and sentimental novels in
                              a network-based approach, a proposal was made here how the concept of
                              family resemblance that has been introduced into genre theory in the
                              1960s and argued for by several genre theorists also recently, can be
                              applied in a digital genre stylistics approach. When one looks at the
                              current strategies to categorize genres in this field, the majority
                              focuses on classificatory groupings based on the assumption of features
                              that are common to all members of a class. Yet, there are also
                              alternative ways to analyze genres in digital stylistics. Especially
                              stylometric network analyses implicitly contain the idea of overlapping
                              similarities and unsharp boundaries characteristic of the family
                              resemblance approach. Here these two scenarios were brought together.
                              With the chosen approach to compare feature distributions of the novels
                              in terms of nearest neighborships and to organize the resulting network
                              of similarities into communities interpreted as <em>families</em>,
                              the original idea of family resemblance is adjusted for the digital
                              analysis. First, because rather than the presence or absence of
                              individual textual features, the degree of their joint presence in
                              individual pairs of novels is decisive, and second, because communities
                              or clusters found in the similarity network constitute a way to delimit
                              the “families” retroactively, without changing the underlying concept of
                              intertwining shared characteristics of individual members of the
                              groups.</p>
                           
                           <p id="p764"><span class="paracount w3-blue-grey w3-margin-right"><a href="#p764">764</a></span>For the Argentine, Mexican, and Cuban historical and
                              sentimental novels, the analysis confirmed that there are subtypes of the
                              subgenres that have been described in literary-historical approaches,
                              such as a novel with a historical setting and a sentimental plot or a
                              historical novel focusing on contemporary political conditions in
                              contrast to novels about historical events about colonial times. In
                              addition, influences of the narrative perspective on subtypes of the
                              sentimental novel became visible. Analyzing both types of subgenres
                              together resulted in mixed groups as well as some that are dominated by
                              one subgenre. While the country the novels were published in does not
                              have a clear impact on the resulting <em>families</em> of novels, the
                              year of publication has an influence in some cases when the preferred and
                              avoided topics reflect the literary development in the nineteenth
                              century.</p>
                           
                           <p id="p765"><span class="paracount w3-blue-grey w3-margin-right"><a href="#p765">765</a></span>The family resemblance analysis is a categorization method
                              that is more open than classification, and if it is applied to more than
                              one type of novel, it allows the novels to be grouped based on criteria
                              other than only their conventional subgenre. All kinds of factors that
                              have an influence on the surface features – as the topics in the analysis
                              conducted here – potentially have an impact on the structure of the
                              family resemblance network if these factors are not controlled beforehand
                              through the composition of the corpus, as was done here with authorship.
                              So depending on how many and which determining factors of style are
                              permitted to enter the network, the family resemblance analysis reveals
                              different stylistic connections between the works, conventional subgenre
                              being one of them. All in all, the results show that features common to
                              all novels of a conventional subgenre cannot be expected and that the
                              textual factors that influence the subgroups or <em>families</em> of
                              subgenres are diverse. There is not one decisive factor, each
                              <em>family</em>&nbsp;has its own traits that hold it together, and
                              inside of each one, there are additional individual traits as well as
                              connections to other <em>families</em>.</p>
                           
                           <p id="p766"><span class="paracount w3-blue-grey w3-margin-right"><a href="#p766">766</a></span>The algorithm producing the family resemblance network and
                              the resulting data offer an empirical ground on which literary historians
                              can look for sense in genre historical terms. The idea of family
                              resemblance that is implemented here is different from Wittgenstein’s
                              metaphor because it is not about resemblances caused by biological
                              kinship or because of the use of the same word for concepts that do not
                              have necessary common semantic features but partial similarities in
                              meaning. It is also not about conventional relationships between the
                              literary works and does not say anything about the historico-cultural and
                              communicative relevance of the connections inside the network. Here the
                              concept is interpreted in terms of textual families. As the family
                              resemblance network is based on stylistic features, it might reveal
                              previously unrecognized textual similarities in addition to confirming
                              known ones on a broader textual basis. By not presupposing strict
                              uniformity inside and strict boundaries between the text types, it might
                              come closer to the multi-faceted genre that the novel is.</p>

                     epoch, etc.) on the textual level has repeatedly been a concern (see,

                     the other hand, differences between linguistic and literary styles are
                     usually not emphasized in linguistic textbooks on the topic, where a
                     general coverage of stylistic phenomena is pursued. This is also due
                     to revised definitions of style. As Sowinski notes: “In älteren
                     Arbeiten zur Stilistik wird Stil ausschließlich literarischen Werken
                     zugesprochen [...]. Erst in neuerer Zeit ist diese Einschränkung
                     gefallen: Stil wird heute allen Texten zugesprochen, wenn auch in
                     unterschiedlicher Art und Weise. [...] Auch die Gebrauchstexte
                     pragmatischer Natur müssen nicht arm an Stilelementen sein, wenn hier
                     auch oft andere Stilzüge (z.B. Ökonomie, Präzision) den Verzicht auf
                     bestimmte Stilelemente, z.B. des affektiven oder bildhaften Bereichs
                     bedingen können” (<span class="w3-tooltip w3-border-bottom w3-border-blue-grey">Sowinski 1999, 73<span class="w3-text w3-tag w3-round w3-blue-grey w3-left-align w3-padding w3-large" style="position:absolute;left:0;bottom:25px">Sowinski, Bernhard. 1999. <em>Stilistik: Stiltheorien
                              und Stilanalysen.</em> Stuttgart: Metzler.</span></span>). However, Sowinski does not discuss how
                     the different elements of style relate to authorship or period. In
                     their “revisited” definition of style, the digital humanists Herrmann,
                     Schöch, and van Dalen-Oskam also strive to offer a generally
                     applicable notion: “In our approach, style is not something unique to
                     literary works; rather, every text has a certain kind of style.” They
                     also have a general view on the issue of the relationship between
                     style and other categories, but with a focus on literary ones: “In our
                     definition, style can be associated with categories such as genre,
                     epoch, author, and many more. In many cases, correlations between
                     specific style markers or groups of style markers with these
                     categories may be observed. What is more, even in the absence of
                     conscious intentions, causal relationships may be hypothesized: genre
                     can cause style (e.g., by means of conventions: form and themes),
                     authors can cause style (e.g., by means of idiosyncrasies), theme and
                     topic can cause style. The interpretability of style relative to
                     categories such as authorship, literary genre, or literary period, is
                     hence paramount. This means that any stylistic phenomenon can
                     ultimately be considered the trace of or the index towards such
                     categories [...]” (<span class="w3-tooltip w3-border-bottom w3-border-blue-grey">Herrmann, Schöch, and van Dalen-Oskam 2015, 46<span class="w3-text w3-tag w3-round w3-blue-grey w3-left-align w3-padding w3-large" style="position:absolute;left:0;bottom:25px">Herrmann, J.

                     Nevertheless, in empirical digital literary studies on genre,
                     authorship is usually the factor that interferes most. The importance
                     of considering literary periods for corpus building in literary
                     studies is stressed by Gemeinböck (<span class="w3-tooltip w3-border-bottom w3-border-blue-grey">2016, 37<span class="w3-text w3-tag w3-round w3-blue-grey w3-left-align w3-padding w3-large" style="position:absolute;left:0;bottom:25px">Gemeinböck, Iris. 2016. “Representativeness in corpora

                     taken here is that although general principles for corpus building and
                     the assessment of representativeness are the same for linguistic and
                     literary corpora (such as determining a population and a sampling
                     frame and following certain sampling strategies), there are
                     differences in the kind and in the relevance of categories to assess
                     internal variability.</div>

                  <div class="w3-container w3-padding-large">The occupation with events that belong to the distant or
                     recent past or are contemporary is not necessarily to be equated with the
                     novels being historical novels or not. As Read states in his study of the
                     Mexican historical novel: “It will be apparent as this study progresses
                     that the works involved fall naturally into two groups, the romantic
                     historical novels that deal with the conquest period and colonial times,
                     and the novels that deal with historical events of the nineteenth
                     century. The first group is essentially romantic, corresponding to the
                     type developed by Walter Scott but with a distinctly local ‘middle ages’.
                     Instead of turning to medieval Europe for exotic material, Mexican
                     writers of this type of fiction sought out characters and institutions of
                     their own dim past. Their hostility to the Spanish regime was still fresh
                     enough to inspire them with a feeling of spiritual kinship with the
                     Amerinds who had been the traditional enemies of the Europeans. [...] In
                     this same group of romantic historical novels belong those fictional
                     works that deal with colonial times. The Inquisition [...] is naturally
                     the center of interest of these poetic interpretations of life in the
                     colony. The second class of Mexican historical novels is that which finds
                     its material in the history of the nineteenth century, the epoch in which
                     the writers themselves had been actors in the dramas they presented. Such
                     works may properly be called novels of contemporary history. Many of them
                     were patterned after the <em>Episodios nacionales</em> of Pérez
                     Galdós and the various historical romances of Erckmann-Chatrian. But
                     though these two groups of works deal with materials from widely
                     separated periods, they have much in common. Whatever the period
                     involved, it was interpreted in terms of the ideals of the nineteenth
                     century when Mexico was attempting to constitute itself a new nation
                     [...]. Patriotism, a new sense of national identity and zeal for liberty
                     and justice were the emotive forces that determined the trend of
                     interpretation in both groups of historical novels to which attention has
                     been called” (<span class="w3-tooltip w3-border-bottom w3-border-blue-grey">Read 1939,

                     historical novels in the strict sense, which broached the issues of the
                     Conquest and colonial times, and novels that treated contemporary
                     historical events or those of the very recent past. Many of the early
                     novels of the latter kind had the Rosas regime as their subject. Molina
                     subsumes them under the group of political novels and calls them “novelas
                     prospectivamente históricas” (<span class="w3-tooltip w3-border-bottom w3-border-blue-grey">Molina 2011, 246–249, 285–311<span class="w3-text w3-tag w3-round w3-blue-grey w3-left-align w3-padding w3-large" style="position:absolute;left:0;bottom:25px">Molina, Sintia. 2001. <em>El Naturalismo en la novela

                     predominant in the realist and naturalistic novels of the later
                     nineteenth century: “With reference to Argentina, it is significant that
                     the development of the realistic novel should coincide with the
                     extraordinary growth and progress which the Republic manifested during
                     the years 1880 to 1900. As this economic and material transformation took
                     place, greatly affecting every facet of the nation’s life [...] eager
                     writers sought to mirror that rapid change and portray the new society
                     that was surging forth” (<span class="w3-tooltip w3-border-bottom w3-border-blue-grey">Lichtblau 1959, 138<span class="w3-text w3-tag w3-round w3-blue-grey w3-left-align w3-padding w3-large" style="position:absolute;left:0;bottom:25px">Lichtblau, Myron I. 1959. <em>The Argentine Novel in

                           States.</span></span>). Regarding the Argentine naturalistic
                     novel, Lichtblau remarks: “Not only did Argentina produce the first
                     naturalistic novelist in Hispanic America in the figure of Cambaceres,
                     but that country displayed as well the greatest over-all development of
                     the naturalistic current in the nineteenth century. The tremendous
                     material advancement, the great influx of immigrants, the changing social
                     pattern, and the growing industrialization of the Republic–all these
                     things writers used to advantage in applying the tenets of Zola to
                     Argentine fiction.” (<span class="w3-tooltip w3-border-bottom w3-border-blue-grey">176–177<span class="w3-text w3-tag w3-round w3-blue-grey w3-left-align w3-padding w3-large" style="position:absolute;left:0;bottom:25px">Lichtblau, Myron I. 1959. <em>The Argentine Novel in

                     de San Ángel” (1865, MX) by Niceto de Zamacois. Surprisingly, the
                     shortest and the longest novel of the corpus were first published in the
                     same year. Despite the lower limit being 16,000 tokens, two novels with
                     approximately 15,800 tokens, among them “Gubi Amaya”, were included
                     because the number of tokens changed in the course of the preparation of
                     the corpus, amongst other things, due to the correction of spelling

                     In figure 144, the number of different labels related to the realization
                     of the discursive act is smaller than the sum of labels related to its
                     three subgroups (“semantic”, “syntactic”, and “medium”) because the same
                     label can be associated with several levels. For example, the labels
                     “novela filosófica” and “novela psicológica” are categorized both as
                     realization/semantic/theme and as
                     realization/syntactic/mode.representation, because the terms point both

                     in a philosophical novel or the focus on personal, emotional states of
                     characters in a psychological novel) and also to a certain way of

                     Roman La parcela (1898) weist er die ästhetische Wortkunst Flauberts oder
                     der Brüder Goncourt ebenso zurück, wie er auch die Obszönität Zolas
                     meiden möchte. Stattdessen bezieht er sich auf die Spanier Galdós und vor
                     allem Pereda, deren Vorliebe für das naturverbundene Leben in der Provinz
                     auch in Portillos Bauernroman ihren thematischen Niederschlag findet. Die
                     Reserve dem französischen Kulturerbe gegenüber hat sich auch in dem Roman
                     Fuertes y débiles (1919) erhalten. Das hier porträtiert porfiristische
                     Gesellschaftssystem krankt daran, dass sich der französische Positivismus

                     romántica no se aclimata en Hispanoamérica hasta el año 1846. Esto
                     significa un claro asincronismo, con respecto a la narrativa de Europa
                     y Estados Unidos, debido a la conflictividad ideológica y la carencia
                     de modelos culturales idóneos. [...] Al margen de los obstáculos
                     históricos, se produce, con una secuenciación discontinua, la
                     introducción de modelos narrativos foráneos. [...] La novela
                     indianista, iniciada muy temprano, en 1832, con Netzula, de Lafragua,
                     se desarrolla en estratificación con los otros metagéneros románticos;
                     en su época culminante, con Cumanda (1871), de Mera, se superpone
                     sobre la narrativa de tendencia realista, a las últimas

                     already covers this feature type. Of the affix-like features,
                     “space-prefix” and “space-suffix” were not selected because they are
                     congruent with “prefix” and “suffix”, the only difference being that they
                     are one character shorter because they start or end with a blank space.
                     “Suffix” was not selected because, in the Spanish language, the suffixes
                     are highly influenced by how pronouns are used (if they are used freely
                     before or attached to verb forms after them). As has been shown in the
                     chapter on text treatment above (see <a href="ch3.html#ch3.3.2">3.3.2</a>), the difference in pronoun use is
                     connected to the type of edition and its publication year, so it cannot
                     be reliably associated with the subgenres. Of the three punctuation-based
                     n-gram types, only “end-punct” was used because it is the only one

                     contributes to the statement of meaning since situations are set up to
                     recognize <em>use</em>. As Wittgenstein says, ‘the meaning of words
                     lies in their use.’ [...] The day-to-day practice of playing language
                     games recognizes customs and rules. It follows that a text in such
                     established usage may contain sentences such as ‘Don’t be such an ass!’,
                     ‘You silly ass!’, ‘What an ass he is!’ In these examples, the word
                     <em>ass</em> is in familiar and habitual company, commonly
                     collocated with <em>you silly—</em>, <em>he is a silly—</em>,
                     <em>don’t be such an—</em>. You shall know a word by the company
                     it keeps! One of the meanings of <em>ass</em> is its habitual

                     scope it has depends on the implementation of the distributional
                     analysis. The two main approaches are to either use surrounding words or
                     to use text regions in which the words occur together as a basis. Current
                     implementations of topic modeling, for instance, Latent Dirichlet
                     Allocation (LDA), usually follow the latter strategy (<span class="w3-tooltip w3-border-bottom w3-border-blue-grey">Sahlgren 2008, 33<span class="w3-text w3-tag w3-round w3-blue-grey w3-left-align w3-padding w3-large" style="position:absolute;left:0;bottom:25px">Sahlgren, Magnus. 2008. “The Distributional Hypothesis.”

                     Depending on the kind and size of the context, Sahlgren differentiates
                     between two types of semantic similarity. According to him, a wider,
                     document-oriented context leads to models that capture “semantic
                     relatedness (e.g. ‘boat’ - ‘water’)”, while a narrower, word-oriented
                     context models “semantic similarity (e.g. ‘boat’ - ‘ship’)” (<span class="w3-tooltip w3-border-bottom w3-border-blue-grey">Sahlgren 2015<span class="w3-text w3-tag w3-round w3-blue-grey w3-left-align w3-padding w3-large" style="position:absolute;left:0;bottom:25px">Sahlgren, Magnus. 2015. “A brief history of word

Finally, for KNN, no feature importances are
                     returned because the classification is made based on similarities between
                     whole data points, which means that all the features of the neighboring
                     points are decisive. So to interpret how important individual features
                     were in this case, other external methods have to be used. One
                     possibility is to use the feature set which worked best with KNN and to
                     calculate how distinctive different features are for the classes in
                     question. For example, this can be done by evaluating which features
                     differ most from the mean values of the features in both the positive and
                     negative class and ranking these features by their distinctiveness. If
                     the full-texts are used as a basis (instead of the specific feature set),
                     zeta-scores can be calculated for the features to find the ones that are
                     distinctive for the classes. For an overview of the zeta-measure of

                     3,000 MFW worked best for the classification of subgenres of the novel
                     with SVM. This is astonishing because they classified
                     nineteenth-century novels in German language and not Spanish. Here,
                     also the plot for SVM was checked, and there the highest mean
                     accuracies are at 3,000 and 4,000 MFW. As Hettinger et al. also
                     analyzed mainly thematic subgenres (adventure novels, social novels,
                     and education novels), it can be hypothesized that a range of 2,000 to
                     4,000 MFW is a good feature choice for the classification of thematic
                     subgenres, independently of the language and classifier. </div>

                     considered, the way to determine the strength of the edges, and the

                     parameter file, and only nouns were kept. In addition, a list of stop
                     words was prepared based on the 50 most frequent nouns and adapted
                     manually. To this, some more stop words were added after inspecting
                     the results of the topic model (e.g., proper names or very general
                     nouns). Before running the topic modeling, the texts were first
                     lemmatized and then segmented into chunks with a length of 1,000
                     tokens. Besides the number of topics, the topic model was created with
                     5,000 iterations. The feature matrices, both for the full and the
                     reduced corpus, can be viewed on GitHub (see the previous
