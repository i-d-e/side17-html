                  builds on terms and concepts from several disciplines. These must be clarified and
                  related to each other, which is the goal of this chapter, in which genre-theoretical
                  aspects, concepts of literary style and literary-historical basics on the
                  Spanish-American novel are discussed. In the first part of this chapter (<a href="ch2.html#ch2.1">2.1</a>), concepts of literary genre are
                  approached. First, it is outlined which scholarly disciplines are concerned with
                  genre studies, which ones are relevant for digital genre stylistics, and how they
                  relate (<a href="ch2.html#ch2.1.1">2.1.1</a>). Then three literary
                  theoretical issues about genre, which have caused much debate in literary genre
                  theory, are discussed, namely their ontological status and relevance (<a href="ch2.html#ch2.1.2">2.1.2</a>), the relationship between systems
                  or theories of genres and their history (<a href="ch2.html#ch2.1.3">2.1.3</a>), and three main types of concepts for genres as categories – logical
                  classes, prototype categories, and family resemblance analysis (<a href="ch2.html#ch2.1.4">2.1.4</a>). All of these theoretical issues are related to
                  digital stylistic genre analyses' practices to find out which genre theoretical
                  concepts are useful and applicable in that field and how literary genre theory and
                  computational genre stylistics interact. In the second main part of this chapter
                  (<a href="ch2.html#ch2.2">2.2</a>), a working definition of literary
                  style is presented as a basis for analyzing metadata and text in the empirical part
                  of the thesis. In the last part, in section <a href="ch2.html#ch2.3">2.3</a>, literary-historical background information is given for three major
                  thematic subgenres and three literary currents of nineteenth-century Spanish-American
                  novels to formulate hypotheses and establish a basis on which they can be analyzed
                  textually.</p>

                        of communicative acts that may be written, spoken, or otherwise represented.
                        Not individual instances of communicative acts are designated by the term
                        “genre”, but the characteristics of groups of them. Genres may be of any sort
                        of communication, for example, instruction manuals or podcasts, but in most
                        cases, “genre” refers to forms of art such as kinds of works in the visual
                        arts, performing arts, music, and literature, the latter being at the center of
                        interest here, more precisely in their written form. This investigation thus
                        focuses on literary genres.<sup id="ftn12" class="w3-btn w3-theme-l3 w3-circle" onclick="document.getElementById('ftn12-modal').style.display='block'">12</sup> In a general
                        sense, literary genres can be understood as groups of literary texts that share
                        or can be referred to with a group name because they have something in common.
                        For example, Agatha Christie’s “Murder on the Orient Express”, Henning
                        Mankell’s “Innan frosten”, or Mario Vargas Llosa’s “Lituma en los Andes” can
                        all be considered <em>novels</em> and, more specifically, <em>crime
                           novels</em>. There has been much debate in literary studies about what the
                        genre names are or should be, what the commonality of the texts belonging to a
                        genre is, and what role genres play for literary texts at all. The
                        investigation of literary genres is an old but still a central problem of
                        literary studies, whether on a theoretical or historical level. The discussion
                        about genres can at least be dated back to antiquity, and often, Aristotle‘s
                        Poetics from c. 335 BCE is cited as one of the initial texts concerned with
                        genre theory.<sup id="ftn13" class="w3-btn w3-theme-l3 w3-circle" onclick="document.getElementById('ftn13-modal').style.display='block'">13</sup> Still today, there is an ongoing debate
                        on the definition of genres both in the sense of general concepts as well as on
                        the level of concrete individual genres, which the vast literature on genre
                        theory and the history of genres shows.<sup id="ftn14" class="w3-btn w3-theme-l3 w3-circle" onclick="document.getElementById('ftn14-modal').style.display='block'">14</sup></p>
                     
                     <p id="p18"><span class="paracount w3-blue-grey w3-margin-right"><a href="#p18">18</a></span>However, literary genres have not only been investigated in
                        literary studies themselves but also within the broader context of textual
                        genres and text classes, for example, in general linguistics, computational
                        linguistics, and information science. While in literary studies, genres are
                        usually understood as kinds of literary works, in linguistics, they tend to be
                        conceived as all sorts of texts, also non-literary ones, and are therefore
                        often referred to as ”text types“.<sup id="ftn15" class="w3-btn w3-theme-l3 w3-circle" onclick="document.getElementById('ftn15-modal').style.display='block'">15</sup> In the field of computational processing of text,
                        there is a tradition, especially in computational linguistics, of describing,
                        detecting, and distinguishing genres and types of text.<sup id="ftn16" class="w3-btn w3-theme-l3 w3-circle" onclick="document.getElementById('ftn16-modal').style.display='block'">16</sup> In
                        computer science, the task of automatically grouping different kinds of texts
                        has been pursued under the labels of “text categorization“ or “text
                        classification“.<sup id="ftn17" class="w3-btn w3-theme-l3 w3-circle" onclick="document.getElementById('ftn17-modal').style.display='block'">17</sup> The term “categorization” is used in
                        different ways in computer science. Sometimes it is understood as equivalent to
                        “classification”, and in other cases, it is only used for unsupervised methods
                        such as clustering.<sup id="ftn18" class="w3-btn w3-theme-l3 w3-circle" onclick="document.getElementById('ftn18-modal').style.display='block'">18</sup> Here, in contrast, the term “categorization” is used
                        in a more general sense to comprise all different kinds of category building.
                        This is the sense of the term that is usually used in literary genre theory

                        literary genre theory that is taken up here is the question of whether genres
                        actually exist. Another question related to it is whether genres are a relevant
                        category for literary analysis at all because if they would not exist, why
                        should they be investigated? Both in the early and late twentieth century,
                        there were theoretical approaches that fundamentally questioned the relevance
                        of genres. According to nominalistic positions, generic terms are just abstract
                        labels to aggregate and subsume similar texts, but genres do not exist. On the
                        other hand, representatives of realistic positions argue that genres exist
                        independently of individual texts, for example, as psychological dispositions

                        “Gattungstheorie. Information und Synthese”, which was published in 1973,
                        Hempfer discusses both kinds of positions in detail by surveying a broad range
                        of approaches that can be subsumed under the labels “nominalistic” versus
                        “realistic”. An important early critic of considering art in terms of genre was
                        Croce, who emphasized the uniqueness and individuality of works of art as a
                        result of the aesthetic and creative impetus of human activity. He considers
                        genres useless and views them as intermediate pseudo-concepts between the
                        individual and the universal, unable to capture or describe the individual
                        expressions (<span class="w3-tooltip w3-border-bottom w3-border-blue-grey">Hempfer 1973,

                        post-structuralist theories. For example, Derrida finds that literary texts
                        essentially break rules, while genres start from the opposite idea of a set of
                        normative rules for text production and reception.<sup id="ftn23" class="w3-btn w3-theme-l3 w3-circle" onclick="document.getElementById('ftn23-modal').style.display='block'">23</sup>
                        Still, he indirectly also recognizes the relevance of genre for the production
                        and reception of literary works by stating that texts participate in genres
                        even if they cannot be neatly assigned to them: 
                        <blockquote>

                           as possible, what I shall call the law of the law of genre. It is
                           precisely a principle of contamination, a law of impurity, a parasitical

                           figuratively, I would speak of a sort of participation without
                           belonging—a taking part in without being part of, without having

                        the one developing the concept of <em>écriture</em>, which was initially
                        formulated by Barthes. He defines <em>écriture</em> as a level between
                        language and style, on which authors can express themselves individually and
                        consciously, engaging in the history of literature and pursuing social
                        intentions. Language, in turn, is naturally given to the writers of a certain
                        period and linguistic context, and it works as a prescriptive and habitual
                        frame. Style, on the other hand, is an individual characteristic of each writer
                        and is just as little controlled as the general language use (<span class="w3-tooltip w3-border-bottom w3-border-blue-grey">Barthes [1953] 2002,

                                 l’écriture.</em> Reprint, Paris: Seuil.</span></span>). Compared to genre, the concept of <em>écriture</em> focuses
                        more on the singularity of texts, their individual interrelationships, and the
                        writing process. From this viewpoint, genres are seen as mere terms that
                        suggest clear differentiations where in fact, the texts interrelate more freely
                        and openly. In this sense, the idea of <em>écriture</em> is linked to
                        recent theories of intertextuality. Nevertheless, as in Derrida’s law of genre,
                        the genres remain a point of reference when texts allude to generic terms and
                        conventions, be it to break them (<span class="w3-tooltip w3-border-bottom w3-border-blue-grey">Schmitz-Emans 2010, 107–109<span class="w3-text w3-tag w3-round w3-blue-grey w3-left-align w3-padding w3-large" style="position:absolute;left:0;bottom:25px">Schmitz-Emans, Monika. 2010. “Écriture und

                        anthropological conceptions of genre, but also communicative and semiotic
                        approaches, including conceptualist positions.<sup id="ftn25" class="w3-btn w3-theme-l3 w3-circle" onclick="document.getElementById('ftn25-modal').style.display='block'">25</sup> In general, communicative theories assume that genres
                        exist as concepts that influence the production and reception of literary
                        works. In a narrower sense, communicative genre theories are linguistically
                        oriented. In a wider sense, theories that emphasize the social functions of
                        genres can also be subsumed under this term. An influential proposition was
                        Voßkamp’s idea to describe genres as “literary-social institutions” that
                        undergo stabilization and dissolution processes and in which socio-historical
                        communicative needs are condensed in a particular time and place. As such,
                        genres are communicative models that are not mere text-internal literary
                        phenomena but determined by a broader societal context (<span class="w3-tooltip w3-border-bottom w3-border-blue-grey">Voßkamp 1977, 30, 32<span class="w3-text w3-tag w3-round w3-blue-grey w3-left-align w3-padding w3-large" style="position:absolute;left:0;bottom:25px">Voßkamp, Wilhelm. 1977. “Gattungen als

                        communicative genre theories, texts, genres, and generic terms are all
                        conceived as complex linguistic signs, and genres can be understood as
                        conventionalized models of an intended message or reality (<span class="w3-tooltip w3-border-bottom w3-border-blue-grey">Raible 1980, 324–326<span class="w3-text w3-tag w3-round w3-blue-grey w3-left-align w3-padding w3-large" style="position:absolute;left:0;bottom:25px">Raible, Wolfgang. 1980. “Was sind Gattungen?

                        conventions and models influence authors producing literary texts and that
                        readers, in their turn, use them to categorize and make sense of individual
                        literary works. That way, genres become part of the communicative process and
                        manifest themselves in it without being equated with a particular part of the
                        process. Statements on and expectations about genres are controlled and
                        triggered through generic signals that can accompany literary texts, be
                        inscribed into them, and interpreted from them.</p>

                        semiotically determined if they are understood as a precondition for the
                        comprehension of literary texts that authors are forced to take into account
                        and not only as historically possible but not necessary options of
                        communication (<span class="w3-tooltip w3-border-bottom w3-border-blue-grey">Hempfer 1973,

                        works cannot be without genre. It does not mean, though, that every work needs
                        to be associated with exactly one genre on one specific level. On the contrary,
                        texts can be influenced by several genres and also on different levels of
                        generality. The mentioned “Murder on the Orient Express” and “Lituma en los
                        Andes” can be interpreted as instances of crime novels and, at the same time,
                        novels and, more generally, narrative. However, “Murder on the Orient Express”
                        can also be analyzed more specifically as a “detective novel” and “Lituma en
                        los Andes” has also been assessed as a “novela indigenista” (<span class="w3-tooltip w3-border-bottom w3-border-blue-grey">Martínez Cantón 2008<span class="w3-text w3-tag w3-round w3-blue-grey w3-left-align w3-padding w3-large" style="position:absolute;left:0;bottom:25px">Martínez Cantón, Clara Isabel. 2008. “El

                        Then again, other texts are only framed by the genre “novel” but not a specific
                        subtype of it. They are sometimes called “general fiction” or “literary
                        fiction”, if the literary merit of the works is stressed.<sup id="ftn26" class="w3-btn w3-theme-l3 w3-circle" onclick="document.getElementById('ftn26-modal').style.display='block'">26</sup> As Raible puts it: “Ein Werk als Exemplar
                        einer Gattung sehen heißt es in eine Reihe von Werken stellen, die analog zu
                        einem Präzedenzfall sind” (<span class="w3-tooltip w3-border-bottom w3-border-blue-grey">Raible

                        have been formed by other works, it becomes part of a system of generic

                        – are understood as communicative objects, they should be described both on the
                        level of the communicative situation and on the level of the textual sign
                        itself. This means that both text-external features, for example, the time and
                        place of its publication, and text-internal features, such as certain elements
                        of content or style, determine how a text participates in a genre.
                        Text-external factors can considerably determine a text's form, and they can
                        narrow down the possibilities of a text's interpretation. However, literary
                        works, especially written ones, are functionally less determined than other

                        conceptions of genre presented so far is Hempfer’s position, which he calls
                        “the constructivist synthesis”. Following Piaget’s theory of knowledge, on the
                        level of scholarly description, he sees genres as structures that emerge from
                        the interaction between the subject that seeks to understand them and the
                        objects to which the structure is applied. These structures constitute a
                        process of approximation between subject and object. As Hempfer formulates it: 
                        <blockquote>
                           Auf der Ebene der historischen Entwicklung lassen sich die
                           ‘Gattungen’ nun nicht im gleichen Sinn wie etwa die Geburt Napoleons als
                           ‘Faktum’ begreifen, sondern es handelt sich, wie in den verschiedensten
                           semiotisch orientierten Gattungstheorien betont wird, um Normen der
                           Kommunikation, die mehr oder weniger interiorisiert sein können. Da diese
                           Normen aber an konkreten Texten ablesbar sind, werden sie für den
                           Analysator zu ‘Fakten’ und lassen sich demzufolge allgemein als
                           <em>faits normatifs</em> verstehen, ein Begriff, den Piaget aus
                           der Soziologie zur Bezeichnung analoger Phänomene in die Psychologie
                           eingeführt hat. Diesen <em>faits normatifs</em> wird dann in der
                           wissenschaftlichen Analyse eine bestimmte Beschreibung zugeordnet, die
                           als solche immer ein aus der Interaktion von Erkenntnissubjekt und zu
                           erkennendem Objekt erwachsenes Konstrukt darstellt.

                        understood as objective facts, but as communicative phenomena that can,
                        however, leave traces in texts. If genres are understood as norms, then such
                        textual traces can be conceived as normative facts in Hempfer’s sense. The
                        connection between genres as communicative norms and the texts on which they
                        have an influence results in turn from the communicatively established
                        assignment of texts to genres. How is it made clear that a text participates in
                        a genre? This can be expressed, for example, through generic signals in the
                        texts but also through signals that accompany the texts (e.g., in subtitles or
                        paratexts). Thus, genre signals and genre names used in connection with
                        literary works have a special significance for establishing genre affiliations.
                        The various references and levels of meaning of such linguistic expressions of
                        genres are broken down, in particular, in semiotic genre theories. Since genre
                        labels are digital genre stylistics’ primary approach to communicative genre
                        norms, semiotic genre models are discussed in more detail in the following

                           genres as signs. As signs, the generic terms can be understood as models for

                           and involves six dimensions from which generic terms usually draw their
                           meaning and classificatory features: 
                           <ol>
                              
                              <li>the communicative situation between sender and recipient
                                 (“Kommunikationssituation”)</li>
                              
                              <li>the object area of the texts involving persons and things
                                 (“Objektbereich”)</li>
                              
                              <li>the higher order structure of texts (“übergeordnete
                                 Ordnungsstruktur”)</li>
                              
                              <li>the relationship between text and reality (“Verhältnis zwischen
                                 Text und Wirklichkeit”)</li>
                              
                              <li>the communicative medium that the text uses (“Medium”)</li>
                              
                              <li>the way of linguistic representation (“sprachliche
                                 Darstellungsweise”).</li>
                              </ol> An example of a generic term that addresses the communicative
                           situation is “children’s book”. In this case, the genre’s name specifies the
                           target group of the texts labeled with it. A term concerning the object area
                           is, for example, “picaresque novel”, which refers to the protagonist’s
                           social status. According to Raible, instances of the third group of terms,
                           which refers to the higher-order structure of the texts, are relatively
                           rare. He gives jokes as examples, as they involve the expectation of
                           something unexpected in their structure. A generic term that addresses the
                           relationship between the text and reality is, for instance, the fable. Terms
                           that relate to the communicative medium can refer to language, other media
                           (music, mimic, rhythm), and carrier media, for example, the “epistolary
                           novel”. Finally, an example for a genre label that alludes to the linguistic
                           representation of the text is “short story”, which refers to the length of
                           the form. Raible sees his model as principally open and refinable through
                           applied literary genre analyses (<span class="w3-tooltip w3-border-bottom w3-border-blue-grey">Raible 1980, 342–345<span class="w3-text w3-tag w3-round w3-blue-grey w3-left-align w3-padding w3-large" style="position:absolute;left:0;bottom:25px">Raible, Wolfgang. 1980. “Was sind Gattungen?

                           has been developed by Schaeffer (<span class="w3-tooltip w3-border-bottom w3-border-blue-grey">1983, 64–130<span class="w3-text w3-tag w3-round w3-blue-grey w3-left-align w3-padding w3-large" style="position:absolute;left:0;bottom:25px">Schaeffer, Jean-Marie. 1983. <em>Qu’est-ce qu’un

                           chooses to approach the complex signs that genres are through the also
                           complex but more tangible names of the genres: 
                           <blockquote>

                              <em>classes générique</em>? Ou, pour éviter de nous encombrer
                              dès le début d’entités peut-être fantomatiques, demandons-nous plutôt:
                              quel est le statut des <em>noms de genres</em>? [...] l’identité
                              d’un genre est fondamentalement celle d’un terme général identique
                              appliqué à un certain nombre de textes. [...] les noms générique
                              traditionnels sont la seule réalité tangible à partir de laquelle
                              nouns en venons à postuler l’existence des classes génériques

                           that a generic class of texts has a communicative existence, condensed in a
                           name. Furthermore, names applied to texts signal that the texts participate
                           in the genres, and the participating texts, in turn, contribute to the
                           genre’s identity. The above quote is intentionally reduced to concentrate on
                           the aspect of relevance of the generic names. In the wider context,
                           Schaeffer explains that the relationship between the generic names and the
                           texts is not at all simple. The names can have different statuses, as
                           analytical ex-post terms, as words in use in a very specific historical
                           situation, or as something between both of these poles. They can be applied
                           collectively to a set of texts at once or to individual texts so that
                           multiple applications of the terms, or their sum, form the genre. The
                           meaning of generic names is not fixed, not synchronically, and especially
                           not over time, and they can be related to other terms. One text can be
                           associated with several generic names, which may involve different levels of
                           significance (<span class="w3-tooltip w3-border-bottom w3-border-blue-grey">Schaeffer 1983,

                           theory of genre with a lexicological study of generic names but wants to
                           start from them to account for the fluent character of the genres and to
                           understand the kind of phenomena that are covered by the generic names (<span class="w3-tooltip w3-border-bottom w3-border-blue-grey">Schaeffer 1983, 75–76<span class="w3-text w3-tag w3-round w3-blue-grey w3-left-align w3-padding w3-large" style="position:absolute;left:0;bottom:25px">Schaeffer, Jean-Marie. 1983. <em>Qu’est-ce qu’un

                           For Schaeffer, a generic term is any term, “á condition qu’il soit utilisé
                           pour classer des œuvre ou des activités verbales linguistiquement et
                           socialement marquées et encadrées (<em>framed</em>), et qui se détachent
                           par là de l’activité langagière courante” (<span class="w3-tooltip w3-border-bottom w3-border-blue-grey">Schaeffer 1983, 77<span class="w3-text w3-tag w3-round w3-blue-grey w3-left-align w3-padding w3-large" style="position:absolute;left:0;bottom:25px">Schaeffer, Jean-Marie. 1983. <em>Qu’est-ce qu’un
                                    genre littéraire?</em> Paris: Seuil.</span></span>). He thus does not
                           start from a strict separation of generic terms for literary and
                           non-literary works, although his study focuses on the former. A condition
                           for a term to be generic is that it is <em>used</em> for classifying
                           works or other linguistically and socially marked and situated verbal
                           activities. This definition again focuses on the communicative function of
                           genres. It is limited to oral and written linguistic acts because it
                           presupposes verbal activities, which excludes, for example, communicative
                           acts in the visual or performing arts or music. However, within the
                           literary-linguistic frame set by Schaeffer, all kinds of generic terms are

                           names do not all refer to one specific dimension of a literary work.
                           Possible dimensions are, for example, the syntactical and semantic chain of
                           a text that expresses a work. Instead, generic terms pick up all kinds of
                           levels of a work as a global discursive act. That way, the generic identity
                           of a literary work is not unique and fixed but depends on the perspective or
                           perspectives taken towards it (<span class="w3-tooltip w3-border-bottom w3-border-blue-grey">Schaeffer 1983, 79–80<span class="w3-text w3-tag w3-round w3-blue-grey w3-left-align w3-padding w3-large" style="position:absolute;left:0;bottom:25px">Schaeffer, Jean-Marie. 1983. <em>Qu’est-ce qu’un
                                    genre littéraire?</em> Paris: Seuil.</span></span>). Similar to Raible, Schaeffer defines a
                           literary work as a complex semiotic object. He describes dimensions of this
                           object to which generic terms usually refer. Schaeffer’s model comprises
                           five principal dimensions: 
                           <ol>
                              
                              <li>utterance of the discursive act (“énonciation”)</li>
                              
                              <li>its destination (“destination”)</li>
                              
                              <li>its function (“fonction”)</li>
                              
                              <li>its semantic realization (“sémantique”)</li>
                              
                              <li>its syntactic realization (“syntaxique”).</li>
                              </ol> The first three levels belong to the communicative frame of the
                           discursive act, and the other two concern its textual realization. Each
                           level is further differentiated by reference parameters: for example, a
                           real, fictitious, or simulated instance of utterance, or grammatical,
                           phonetic, metric, or stylistic constraints on the syntactic level. Schaeffer
                           also stresses that the model should not be considered complete but
                           representative or exemplary (<span class="w3-tooltip w3-border-bottom w3-border-blue-grey">Schaeffer 1983, 116<span class="w3-text w3-tag w3-round w3-blue-grey w3-left-align w3-padding w3-large" style="position:absolute;left:0;bottom:25px">Schaeffer, Jean-Marie. 1983. <em>Qu’est-ce qu’un

                           different levels, he mentions, amongst others: a letter or a prayer as
                           instances of a directed utterance, a love poem or ode as examples of an
                           expressive function, a science-fiction story or a western as specific
                           semantic realizations, and a lipogram (forms requiring that specific letters
                           are left out) as a kind of syntactic realization (<span class="w3-tooltip w3-border-bottom w3-border-blue-grey">Schaeffer 1983, 96, 102, 108, 114<span class="w3-text w3-tag w3-round w3-blue-grey w3-left-align w3-padding w3-large" style="position:absolute;left:0;bottom:25px">Schaeffer, Jean-Marie. 1983. <em>Qu’est-ce qu’un

                           objects are characterized by differentiation and openness. An advantage is
                           that they enhance the comparability of different genres by clarifying on
                           which discursive levels generic terms operate without restricting the
                           functioning of genres to a specific communicative level. On the other hand,
                           some genre theoretical aspects are not clarified by these models because
                           they focus on the communicative nature of generic structures. For instance,
                           the semiotic models do not include the generic terms’ provenience and their
                           theoretical or historical nature into the core model, nor do they make
                           statements about the kind of categories that genres can be (if they are to
                           be understood as classes of texts, as prototypical structures, or other
                           types of categoric relationships between literary works). Therefore, these
                           two genre theoretical aspects are discussed further in the subchapters <a href="ch2.html#ch2.1.3">2.1.3</a> (“System and History”) and

                           another aspect of genres: who says that there are no communicative patterns
                           without a name? There may be genres that have not been explicitly discussed
                           or labeled but nonetheless exist as frames for communicative acts. A sign of
                           this is that there are genres that have primarily been labeled by literary
                           scholars in retrospect but that were not explicitly named in their
                           historical peak phase. This does not necessarily mean that the scholars made
                           arbitrary classifications without considering contemporary communicative
                           practices. For example, both the <em>novela gauchesca</em> and the
                           <em>novela indigenista</em> could not be found as explicit generic
                           labels in the bibliography and corpus of nineteenth-century Spanish-American
                           novels that were prepared for this dissertation.<sup id="ftn29" class="w3-btn w3-theme-l3 w3-circle" onclick="document.getElementById('ftn29-modal').style.display='block'">29</sup>
                           They are, nonetheless, established subgenres of the novel in the

                           limited to explicit mentions of generic names. They can also be implicit or

                           Hempfer’s synthesis can be productively related to approaches pursued in
                           digital genre stylistics. In digital stylistics, the anchoring point between
                           genres as communicative norms and their descriptions in terms of textual
                           features is just the style of the texts. Whenever literary works are
                           associated with specific genres, a basic assumption for a digital stylistic
                           genre analysis is the following: that the text style can be analyzed to
                           assess to what degree there are <em>normative facts</em> expressing the
                           generic participations of the works in the genres and of what these facts
                           consist. Obviously, the analysis of text style is limited to the syntactic
                           realization of the discursive act, but this does not mean that digital
                           stylistic concepts of genre are reduced to this level of communication. The
                           level on which digital genre stylistics principally operates is the
                           linguistic, strictly speaking, even the orthographic surface of certain
                           manifestations of literary texts as they are transmitted in a form that is
                           determined by the digital medium. Still, many kinds of discursive aspects
                           can be analyzed on this level. The crucial point is how the participation of
                           the texts in genres is modeled and defined. As several literary genre
                           theorists have pointed out, texts can be classified arbitrarily by any
                           criterion, and this would include any computationally tractable aspect of
                           text style.<sup id="ftn30" class="w3-btn w3-theme-l3 w3-circle" onclick="document.getElementById('ftn30-modal').style.display='block'">30</sup> Such an endeavor is not the point in itself. The question
                           is to which communicative norms of genre the texts relate and in what way. A
                           good example of taking the relativity and significance of generic
                           assignments into account is a study conducted by Underwood, in which he
                           analyzes different definitions of Gothic novels at different points in
                           time.<sup id="ftn31" class="w3-btn w3-theme-l3 w3-circle" onclick="document.getElementById('ftn31-modal').style.display='block'">31</sup> As Underwood
                           states: 
                           <blockquote>
                              Distant reading may seem to lend itself, inevitably, to literary
                              scholar’s fixation on genre as an attribute of textual artifacts. But
                              the real value of quantitative methods could be that they allow
                              scholars to coordinate textual and social approaches to genre. This
                              essay will draw one tentative connection of that kind. It approaches
                              genre initially as a question about the history of reception —
                              gathering lists of titles that were grouped by particular readers or
                              institutions at particular historical moments. But it also looks
                              beyond those titles to the texts themselves. Contemporary practices of
                              statistical modeling allow us to put different groups of texts into
                              dialogue with each other.

                           life cycle of genres. Some critics sustain that genres have relatively short
                           life cycles, roughly corresponding to one generation and about 25 years.
                           Others say that genres can sustain an identity over periods much longer than
                           that, even if there are shifts in the concept of the genre. “Textual
                           analysis won’t prove either claim wrong, but it may help us understand how
                           they’re compatible” (<span class="w3-tooltip w3-border-bottom w3-border-blue-grey">Underwood

                           of digital genre stylistics: not necessarily to refute or confirm claims
                           that are made on other levels of genre investigation (as here in the history
                           of reception), but to look for textual and more specifically stylistic
                           evidence as traces of these other levels. That way, genres are not
                           established <em>in</em> style, but <em>through</em> style. Underwood
                           aims to investigate how textually coherent the Gothic is over time: 
                           <blockquote>
                              Evidence of this kind [that only a one-generational linguistic
                              coherence could be found] wouldn’t rule out the possibility of
                              longer-term continuity: we don’t know, after all, that books need to
                              resemble each other textually in order to belong to the same genre.
                              But if we did find that textual coherence was strongest over short
                              timespans, we might conclude at least that generation-sized genres

                           between social and communicative norms of genre and stylistic textual
                           evidence, several aspects in the connective chain need to be defined and
                           selected with care. Usually, a corpus of texts is analyzed, and the generic
                           conventions in question are expressed as genre labels of the texts, which
                           themselves are representatives of literary works. The assignment of genre
                           labels to the texts is the first crucial point. Which kind of genre labels
                           are selected, and how are they assigned to the texts? The semiotic models of
                           generic terms provide a way to differentiate between different discursive
                           levels on which genres can be defined, which can help not to compare “apples
                           with oranges”. That would happen if one would, for example, contrast
                           primarily formally defined genres with thematically defined ones. The
                           sources of the genre labels should always be indicated to document which
                           kind of generic convention they represent. Do the genre attributions go back
                           to assignments made to individual texts by different authors, editors, or
                           publishers? Or are they collectively defined, for example, established in a
                           discussion of a set of works by a contemporary critic or poet, by modern
                           institutions, or by a literary historian? Are the assignments made based on
                           explicit generic terms or implicit signals of the texts? Or are they derived
                           from specific theoretical definitions of genres that are applied to the
                           texts? Depending on the answers, quite different kinds of generic
                           conventions can be analyzed. In the worst case, it is not clear which type
                           of genre an analysis aims at, and the goal of addressing a communicative
                           pattern that lies outside of the analysis itself would be missed. Awareness
                           of the kind of analysis target can still be raised in digital genre

                           advice and intentions to analyze genres or subgenres only on a defined

                           especially large-scale digital analysis using hundreds or even thousands of
                           texts have to face challenges in defining which generic conventions they
                           refer to. Even in qualitatively oriented genre analysis, selecting works for
                           a corpus that aims to cover one or several specific genres is not trivial. A
                           starting point using either certain labels or definitions of the genre(s)
                           has to be found.<sup id="ftn34" class="w3-btn w3-theme-l3 w3-circle" onclick="document.getElementById('ftn34-modal').style.display='block'">34</sup> Beyond that, some strategies of text selection and
                           genre assignment are not viable for very large corpora. It is, for example,
                           not possible to read every text and check it against a genre definition that
                           relies on qualitative textual features, i.e., characteristics of the texts
                           that are not (yet) easily formalized and computationally analyzable.
                           Furthermore, it is very likely that large corpora also cover lesser-known
                           texts which critics have not considered yet. That way, existing critical
                           approaches may only cover part of a text corpus. On the other hand,
                           depending on the kind of genre, explicit labels on historical editions may
                           also not be the norm. These are additional difficulties that quantitative
                           genre analysis faces in defining of its object of investigation through the
                           selection and preparation of the text collection. Such challenges make it
                           even more important to clarify which genre convention is addressed and how

                           fundamental point for a digital genre analysis is the selection of textual
                           features. In the end, the <em>normative facts</em> that can be found in
                           the texts, that can be related to genre conventions, and that can be used to
                           establish definitions of genres, depend on which kind of textual material is
                           analyzed. There are different opinions regarding the importance of which
                           kind of features are selected. Underwood, for example, highlights the
                           predictive power of statistical models, which is based on specific features
                           but not directly dependent on them: 
                           <blockquote>
                              Leo Breiman has emphasized that predictive models depart from
                              familiar statistical methods (and I would add, from traditional
                              critical procedures) by bracketing the quest to identify underlying
                              factors that really cause and explain the phenomenon being studied.
                              Where genre is concerned, this means that our goal is no longer to
                              define a genre, but to find a model that can reproduce the judgements
                              made by particular historical observers.

                           for a statistical model to recognize instances of the genre. Still, he
                           argues, these genre markers do not need to correspond to any definition of
                           the genre that has been formulated so far, and they might not lead to any
                           definition that could be articulated verbally in a useful way (<span class="w3-tooltip w3-border-bottom w3-border-blue-grey">Underwood 2016, 6<span class="w3-text w3-tag w3-round w3-blue-grey w3-left-align w3-padding w3-large" style="position:absolute;left:0;bottom:25px">Underwood, Ted. 2016. “The Life Cycles of Genres.”

                           Underwood’s stance towards selecting textual features is characterized by a
                           reproductive strategy on the one hand and an explorative one on the other.
                           It is a reproductive strategy in the sense that text analysis is used to
                           replicate social constructions of genre to find out about their general
                           relationship to the textual basis. It is explorative in that the kind of
                           features used is not defined in a top-down approach and controlled in
                           advance, but tested as for their reproductive relevance: “To put it more
                           pointedly: computational methods make contemporary genre theory useful. We
                           can dispense with fixed definitions, and base the study of genre only on the
                           shifting practices of particular historical actors – but still produce
                           models of genre substantive enough to compare and contrast. Since no causal
                           power is ascribed to variables in a predictive model, the choice of features
                           is not all-important” (<span class="w3-tooltip w3-border-bottom w3-border-blue-grey">6<span class="w3-text w3-tag w3-round w3-blue-grey w3-left-align w3-padding w3-large" style="position:absolute;left:0;bottom:25px">Underwood, Ted. 2016. “The Life Cycles of Genres.”

                           as traces of social constructs of genres would not lead to descriptions of
                           them in scholarly terms, at least not to definitions focusing on the kinds

                           the formulation of an initial thesis and is more driven by prior theoretical
                           assumptions than in Underwood’s approach.<sup id="ftn35" class="w3-btn w3-theme-l3 w3-circle" onclick="document.getElementById('ftn35-modal').style.display='block'">35</sup> It
                           represents a deductive procedure. In the case of genre analysis, a
                           genre-related thesis would need to be formulated, for instance: “In social
                           novels, there are more different characters than in sentimental novels”. To
                           be able to verify or falsify the hypothesis through computational text
                           analysis, it would be necessary to define textual indicators representing
                           the concepts mentioned in the hypothesis. The above example would require an
                           approach to identify characters in the text, for example, by detecting
                           mentions of character names and other linguistic references to characters
                           and resolving to which character they point. It would be necessary to
                           automatically detect the set of different characters in a novel, which is a
                           difficult task. Somewhat easier to formalize and closer to a stylistic
                           analysis would be a hypothesis such as “In social novels, there are more
                           mentions of different character names than in sentimental novels”. Like the
                           explorative procedures, also top-down approaches have several advantages and
                           disadvantages. What is good about them is that they start directly from the
                           scholarly field that is also the target context. If the goal is to find out
                           something about literary genres and the hypothesis is formulated in literary
                           scholarly terms, the hypothesis is compatible with the epistemological frame
                           of the investigation. In addition, the selection of textual indicators and
                           features can be motivated theoretically so that meaningful and interpretable
                           results can be expected. The main disadvantage is that the possibility of
                           formalizing the hypotheses depends on the available technical methods.
                           Although research is done in this direction, many literary theoretical
                           concepts still need to be formalizable.<sup id="ftn36" class="w3-btn w3-theme-l3 w3-circle" onclick="document.getElementById('ftn36-modal').style.display='block'">36</sup> Existing text mining
                           methods, for example, topic modeling or sentiment analysis, may also be used
                           to operationalize the hypotheses. Then it must be explained in what way they
                           can be considered formalizations of literary theoretical concepts, such as
                           themes, topoi, or emotions. In any case, in such an approach, the selection
                           of specific textual features is not at all arbitrary or negligible. The
                           features represent the texts and are assumed to cover stylistic aspects that
                           are traces of generic conventions in the texts. The chosen indicators must
                           be suited to check the plausibility of the literary theoretical hypothesis.
                           At the same time, the choice of the indicators themselves is based on
                           assumptions: “Das Verhältnis zwischen Indikatoren und These ist allerdings

                           analysis, the suitability of the features needs to be tested empirically to
                           some degree.</p>

                           analyzed and the selection of corresponding genre labels, the choice of
                           textual features for a digital stylistic genre analysis should also be
                           motivated. How specific the chosen features are and how important it is to
                           clarify their relationship to literary theoretical concepts depends on the
                           kind of strategy that is chosen for the genre analysis: it can be primarily
                           deductive, inductive, or experimental, and it can be theoretically or
                           historically oriented. In principle, digital genre analysis can be used for
                           all kinds of investigations. The goal can be, for instance, to find out if
                           and in what way works with specific historical or critical genre labels are
                           textually coherent, as Underwood did. Another goal can be to test if a
                           specific scholarly definition of a genre holds when it is formalized and
                           applied to a corpus of texts that have been assigned to the genre in
                           question. The results of a stylistic genre analysis could also be used to
                           formulate new, statistically-based definitions of genres. Even if textual
                           variables in statistical models do not necessarily reflect causal
                           relationships, their distribution can be interpreted to reach empirically
                           based genre definitions if genres can be distinguished based on these
                           variables. A sentence in such a definition could be, for example, “the genre
                           X is defined such that the probability of a love topic is significantly
                           higher in texts that participate in the genre X than in texts that do not
                           participate in this genre”. In Hempfer’s terms, the normative fact that was
                           found is the different probability of a certain kind of topic in two groups
                           of texts that are associated with different genres by convention. The genre
                           is constructed in the interaction of the scholar who decides which textual
                           features to use and which texts to analyze on the one side and the texts
                           themselves on the other. Moreover, the scholar has to interpret the topics
                           and decide that one of them can be described with the term “love”.
                           Furthermore, it has to be decided what “significantly higher” means. A
                           definitory phrase such as the one above can itself be used as a hypothesis
                           that can be tested in other empirical settings, for example, with a
                           different corpus of texts. To what extent the found textual characteristics
                           of exemplars of different genres actually correspond to conscious social
                           norms can only be clarified by analyzing contemporary or historical
                           discussions about what the genres in question are. That would not be
                           different in non-computational text analysis. In addition, besides starting
                           from known generic conventions or scholarly definitions of genre, a digital
                           stylistic genre analysis can also start from the texts themselves. For
                           instance, a corpus of texts can be built for a certain period and a specific
                           cultural, geographical, and linguistic context. It can then be analyzed
                           which groups of texts emerge as textually coherent when specific textual
                           features are used. Such an approach would allow for the possibility of
                           detecting <em>faits normatifs</em> as signs of communicative patterns
                           that might not have had a high degree of explicitness. They might not have
                           been frequently named or broadly discussed in the historical context, and
                           possibly they have not been described yet in scholarly terms. In such cases,
                           it would as well be possible to complement the quantitative analysis with a
                           qualitative study of intertextual links, of implicit or explicit signals in
                           the texts and paratexts, and of metatextual statements that could
                           substantiate or question the communicative relevance of new findings of text
                           groups.</p>

                           generic conventions, a difficult point is how clearly the relationship
                           between both characteristics of texts can be established: having certain
                           features or a specific distribution of them on the one hand and
                           participating in a particular generic convention on the other. In this
                           context, only the causal relationship between the genre label and the
                           textual features is meant, not the question of the kind of social, generic
                           norms and their unconscious or conscious application. In many cases,
                           literary-historical studies of genres focus only on one, positively
                           described genre.<sup id="ftn37" class="w3-btn w3-theme-l3 w3-circle" onclick="document.getElementById('ftn37-modal').style.display='block'">37</sup> Often subtypes of one
                           genre are distinguished as part of the investigation, especially if a major
                           genre is concerned,<sup id="ftn38" class="w3-btn w3-theme-l3 w3-circle" onclick="document.getElementById('ftn38-modal').style.display='block'">38</sup> but explicitly contrastive

                           and empirical digital genre stylistic analysis, it is more usual to directly
                           contrast different genres or subgenres to find distinctive features for each
                           group (see, for instance, <span class="w3-tooltip w3-border-bottom w3-border-blue-grey">Schöch

                           bring forth features that are decisive for distinguishing different classes

                           only the characteristics of one genre are worked out, one cannot say with
                           certainty that there are not other genres that share part of these
                           characteristics. This possibility is avoided in contrastive studies. On the
                           other hand, the results of comparative approaches obviously depend on what
                           is compared. A contrastive text analysis aiming to define the sentimental
                           novel, which is based on a corpus of sentimental, historical, and adventure
                           novels, will lead to a definition of the sentimental novel that is relative
                           to the other subgenres. If sentimental novels were instead compared to
                           science fiction and crime novels, different aspects might be decisive in
                           their distinction and recognition. The choice of the corpus that is used to
                           determine a genre in the context of other genres is, therefore, a central
                           aspect of digital stylistic genre analysis. In the case of contrastive
                           analysis, the relationship between the textual features and the genre in
                           question is established <em>relative</em> to other genres on which the
                           outcomes depend.</p>
                        
                        <p id="p46"><span class="paracount w3-blue-grey w3-margin-right"><a href="#p46">46</a></span>Another challenge in this regard is that text style is not only
                           a function of genre. All kinds of intra- and extra-textual phenomena shape
                           the style of a text. A special awareness of this circumstance has developed
                           in the field of authorship attribution, where it was repeatedly noted that,
                           for example, the period a text was written and published in but also its
                           genre interfere with authorship signal.<sup id="ftn42" class="w3-btn w3-theme-l3 w3-circle" onclick="document.getElementById('ftn42-modal').style.display='block'">42</sup> In the same way, authorship, time
                           period, and other factors can also obscure the link of textual features to
                           genre.<sup id="ftn43" class="w3-btn w3-theme-l3 w3-circle" onclick="document.getElementById('ftn43-modal').style.display='block'">43</sup>
                           It may thus happen that conclusions are drawn about genre that are instead
                           due to unrecognized effects of other variables. Considering the different
                           discursive levels on which generic terms and genres can be defined, it is
                           also likely that these different levels may correlate or interfere with each
                           other. For example, in the bibliography of nineteenth-century
                           Spanish-American novels that was prepared for this dissertation, there are
                           172 novels with the primary thematic subgenre “novela sentimental”. For 85
                           of these, the literary current to which they belong is unknown. 72 have been
                           associated with the romantic current, 15 with the realist, eight with the
                           naturalistic, and two with the modernist current.<sup id="ftn44" class="w3-btn w3-theme-l3 w3-circle" onclick="document.getElementById('ftn44-modal').style.display='block'">44</sup> Putting aside the cases of
                           unknown literary currents, the numbers suggest a strong correlation between
                           a primarily sentimental theme and the romantic current. Definitions of the
                           sentimental novel derived from this set of novels will therefore be strongly
                           influenced by the period in which the romantic current was the dominant
                           aesthetic program.</p>
                        
                        <p id="p47"><span class="paracount w3-blue-grey w3-margin-right"><a href="#p47">47</a></span>If there are undesired factors that influence the target style
                           that is analyzed (e.g., the influence of period on genre style if genre is
                           the primary concern), then several strategies are possible to cope with such
                           factors. A crucial aspect is the construction of the text corpus that is
                           used for the genre analysis. For example, it is possible to include only one
                           text or an equal number of texts per author. This prevents the results from
                           being too much influenced by authors that were very productive writers of
                           texts that can be attributed to specific genres. However, in most cases,
                           creating a balanced corpus means moving away from a text collection that
                           represents the historical proportions of works according to specific
                           criteria. It means that one tries to create a synthetic setting that can be
                           used to get results that are free from unwanted influencing factors in order
                           to reach a definition of the subject that is theoretically “clean”. This may
                           be very difficult if there are not enough sources for such a corpus. Going
                           back to the Spanish-American sentimental novels, taking an equal number of
                           romantic and realistic sentimental novels would reduce the number of novels
                           to analyze to 30 instead of 172. Besides controlling external factors
                           through corpus building, another possibility is to try to choose the text
                           features in such a way that they are likely to be relevant for specific
                           generic distinctions but not for other kinds of differences. However, it has
                           so far not been possible to isolate features that are only connected to a
                           single extra- or intratextual influencing factor.<sup id="ftn45" class="w3-btn w3-theme-l3 w3-circle" onclick="document.getElementById('ftn45-modal').style.display='block'">45</sup> A third way
                           would be to model the factors that are assumed to influence the target
                           variable, for example, by collecting corresponding metadata and using this
                           information when the analysis results are inspected. In principle, a corpus
                           that is created by random sampling may represent historical imbalances.
                           However, it would still be possible to estimate how much influence other
                           factors have on the stylistic features that are interpreted in terms of the
                           genres that are investigated. The decision for a specific strategy to
                           control different factors that may influence the text style may depend on
                           the aim of the study. The wider the claim of validity is for the results
                           that are reached, i.e., the more independent they should be from contextual
                           determinations and intra-textual correlates, the more important it is to
                           build a corpus and features that are theoretically adequate. The narrower
                           the scope of the genre study, the more it will be acceptable to have a
                           corpus and feature set that is influenced by the specific historical
                           setting, and that leads to a less theoretical but more organic description
                           of the genres in question. Looked at another way, the stronger the
                           theoretical claim on the results of a corpus-based study, the more important
                           it is to control for possible factors influencing the target variable of the
                           study, i.e., literary genres. On the other hand, a primary interest in
                           historical adequacy can be pursued by considering and investigating
                           influencing factors, but not necessarily controlling them, for example, by
                           balancing a corpus of texts. Awareness of influencing factors is still
                           indispensable in both cases to make sure that the assertions made are about
                           genre at all.</p>
                        
                        <p id="p48"><span class="paracount w3-blue-grey w3-margin-right"><a href="#p48">48</a></span>It is clear that the ontological status of genres as
                           conventions or norms of communication or social interaction – if they are
                           understood in that way – makes the access that digital genre stylistics has
                           to them one that is mediated by text style. Text style, in turn, is
                           influenced by a number of factors other than genre. These influence factors
                           are never captured as a whole but only on selected levels of textual
                           features that are chosen for analysis. One could say that genre “hangs by a
                           thread” for digital stylistics, but in general, in the debate about the
                           status of genres, the field can be characterized as inclined towards the
                           realistic side. How strong the connection between genres, genre labels, and
                           genre signals, on the one hand, and common features of text groups, on the
                           other hand, is, can be analyzed in detail with digital text analysis. It is
                           to be expected that the results may be quite different depending on the
                           kinds of genres and the literary-historical contexts that are investigated.
                           Quantitative approaches lend themselves very well to analyzing big corpora
                           of formula fiction, that is, popular genre fiction for which uniform
                           patterns of style are expected. In such a research setting, genres are
                           probably more tangible than in an analysis of highly canonized,
                           individualistic works of art where generic references may be weaker.<sup id="ftn46" class="w3-btn w3-theme-l3 w3-circle" onclick="document.getElementById('ftn46-modal').style.display='block'">46</sup> Furthermore, as
                           was pointed out above, digital genre stylistics is a field that is closely
                           linked to computational linguistics, and the existence of linguistic text
                           types is less questioned than the one of literary genres, mainly because it
                           is more evident that the text types constitute communicative norms.</p>

                           linked to terminological questions. Another aspect is the debate about the

                     <p id="p51"><span class="paracount w3-blue-grey w3-margin-right"><a href="#p51">51</a></span>There is a range of different propositions for defining the
                        relationship between systematic and historical genre concepts. An early
                        proposal was formulated by Todorov, who argued for the necessity to distinguish
                        between theoretical genres that arise from deductive procedures and are based
                        on a theory of literature and historical genres that are captured by observing
                        the historical, literary reality. Todorov sees historical genres as a
                        sub-ensemble of theoretical genres. That the definition of theoretical genres
                        depends on a theory of literature is explained by Todorov as follows: a theory
                        of literature involves a concept of how a literary work is represented. A
                        theory of genres then refers to the theoretical concept of the literary work to
                        determine on which levels of this concept genres are defined and which generic
                        characteristics are available on each level. According to Todorov, three
                        aspects must be distinguished for a representation of a work: the verbal, the
                        syntactic, and the semantic aspect. The first one corresponds to concrete
                        phrases of a text that represents a literary work and is connected to questions
                        of register,<sup id="ftn47" class="w3-btn w3-theme-l3 w3-circle" onclick="document.getElementById('ftn47-modal').style.display='block'">47</sup> style, and the
                        instance&nbsp;enunciating or receiving the text. The second level concerns the
                        composition of a literary work, that is, the organization of its different
                        parts (logically, temporally, or spatially). For the third level, the semantic
                        one, the themes or topics of the literary work are relevant (<span class="w3-tooltip w3-border-bottom w3-border-blue-grey">Todorov 1970, 24–25<span class="w3-text w3-tag w3-round w3-blue-grey w3-left-align w3-padding w3-large" style="position:absolute;left:0;bottom:25px">Todorov, Tzvetan. 1970. <em>Introduction à la
                                 littérature fantastique.</em> Paris: Seuil.</span></span>). Possible
                        theoretical genres are deducted from the constellations of characteristics that
                        are available on the different levels that the literary work is defined on. The
                        historical genres are a sub-ensemble of them because not all of the
                        theoretically possible genres may be found in the history of literature.
                        Although Todorov proposes a clear distinction between theoretical and
                        historical genres, he also sees how they are interrelated: 
                        <blockquote>
                           Les genres que nous déduisons à partir de la théorie doivent être
                           vérifiés sur les textes: si nos déductions ne correspondent à aucune
                           œuvre, nous suivons une fausse piste. D’autre part, les genres que nous
                           rencontrons dans l’histoire littéraire doivent être soumis à
                           l’explication d’une théorie cohérente ; sinon, nous restons prisonniers
                           de préjugés transmis de siècle en siècle [...]. La définition des genres
                           sera donc un va-et-vient continuel entre la description des faits et la
                           théorie en son abstraction.

                        theoretical as well as historical genres) do not <em>exist</em> in the
                        literary works, but rather that they are <em>manifested</em> in them.
                        According to Todorov, if a theory tries to explain it, the relationship of
                        manifestation between genres and works is characterized by
                        <em>probability</em> and cannot be seen as absolute (<span class="w3-tooltip w3-border-bottom w3-border-blue-grey">Todorov 1970, 26<span class="w3-text w3-tag w3-round w3-blue-grey w3-left-align w3-padding w3-large" style="position:absolute;left:0;bottom:25px">Todorov, Tzvetan. 1970. <em>Introduction à la
                                 littérature fantastique.</em> Paris: Seuil.</span></span>). An important
                        point can be derived from Todorov’s explanations: even historical descriptions
                        of genres depend on theoretical presuppositions, or rather, different genre
                        theories vary in the extent to which they integrate historical observations
                        into their definitions of generic systems and genres. The debate about a system
                        versus a history of genres can then be viewed as one of degree (from the
                        extreme that history is not needed to establish a theory of genres to the other
                        that a theory of genres is only possible in the description of historical
                        circumstances) and terminology (are different kinds of genres,
                        abstract-theoretical and historical ones, to be distinguished and which notion
                        should be called a “genre”?).</p>
                     
                     <p id="p53"><span class="paracount w3-blue-grey w3-margin-right"><a href="#p53">53</a></span>As was outlined in the previous chapter, the different genre
                        theories that can be ascribed to the realistic side concentrate on different
                        locations of the <em>being</em> of genres. The ones that see it as
                        primarily determined by production would also need to focus on the productive
                        side to describe genres historically, for instance, on the history of the
                        creation and publication of the literary works that participate in the genres.
                        In the same way, if genres are primarily conceptualized as a phenomenon of
                        reception, the history of the reception of literary works that are seen as
                        instances of the genres becomes a central element of the theory. Such a genre
                        theory is, for example, sketched by the romance philologist Jauß. Croce’s
                        rejection of genres as relevant concepts because every work of art is
                        individual and violates genres is taken up by Jauß, who objects that a literary
                        work can only be understood as breaking the rules of genres if there is a
                        previous understanding of these rules: “it still presupposes preliminary
                        information and a trajectory of expectations (<em>Erwartungsrichtung</em>)
                        against which to register the originality and novelty” (<span class="w3-tooltip w3-border-bottom w3-border-blue-grey">Jauß 2014, 131<span class="w3-text w3-tag w3-round w3-blue-grey w3-left-align w3-padding w3-large" style="position:absolute;left:0;bottom:25px">Jauß, Hans Robert. 2014. “Theory of Genres and Medieval

                        expected is conceived as the contemporaneous reader’s knowledge of tradition
                        and experience with other literary works. Because such a horizon of expectation
                        is always present, there is no work without a genre. Because the horizon may be
                        shifted with the experience that a reader makes with new works, genres have a
                        “processlike appearance and ‘legitimate transitoriness’” (<span class="w3-tooltip w3-border-bottom w3-border-blue-grey">Jauß 2014, 131<span class="w3-text w3-tag w3-round w3-blue-grey w3-left-align w3-padding w3-large" style="position:absolute;left:0;bottom:25px">Jauß, Hans Robert. 2014. “Theory of Genres and Medieval

                              New York: Routledge.</span></span>). Jauß concludes that “literary
                        genres are to be understood not as <em>genera</em> (classes) in the logical
                        senses, but rather as <em>groups</em> or <em>historical families</em>.
                        As such, they cannot be deduced or defined, but only historically determined,
                        delimited, and described” (<span class="w3-tooltip w3-border-bottom w3-border-blue-grey">Jauß 2014,

                              New York: Routledge.</span></span>). Because the readers’ horizon of expectation cannot be determined
                        from a purely theoretical standpoint, Jauß’ genre theory is essentially
                        historical. However, it is still a theory, especially when the approach is used
                        to trace the history of one or several genres in broader lines: 
                        <blockquote>
                           the history of genres in this perspective also presupposes reflection
                           on that which can become visible only to the retrospective observer: the
                           beginning character of the beginnings and the definite character of an
                           end; the norm-founding or norm-breaking role of particular examples; and
                           finally, the historical as well as the aesthetic significance of
                           masterworks, which itself may change with the history of their effects
                           and later interpretations, and thereby may also differently illuminate
                           the coherence of the history of their genre that is to be
                           narrated.

                        the history of a genre is not only determined by the contemporaneous context of
                        reception but also depends on how broadly the temporal context is chosen and
                        which perspective the scholar has on it. This view can as well be related to
                        Hempfer’s constructivist synthesis: In this case, the <em>normative
                           facts</em> are the expressions of horizons of expectations about genres,
                        which must be substantiated through historical sources,<sup id="ftn48" class="w3-btn w3-theme-l3 w3-circle" onclick="document.getElementById('ftn48-modal').style.display='block'">48</sup> and the genres are

                        determining trans-temporal basic genres. One example is Goethe’s attempt to
                        define the epic, the lyric, and the drama as the three genuine natural forms
                        (<span class="w3-tooltip w3-border-bottom w3-border-blue-grey">Genette 2014, 212<span class="w3-text w3-tag w3-round w3-blue-grey w3-left-align w3-padding w3-large" style="position:absolute;left:0;bottom:25px">Genette, Gérard. 2014. “The Architext.” In <em>Modern

                        Problems with the definitions of these three natural forms are pointed out by
                        Genette, who introduces a more differentiated terminological system. It aims to
                        clarify which aspects of the three basic forms can be considered
                        trans-historical and which ones are historically bound. For Genette, the
                        lyrical, epical, and the dramatic can be defined as “modes”, understood as
                        linguistic categories that describe the mode of enunciation, for example,
                        narration in the case of the epical and dramatic representation for the
                        dramatic. On the other hand, as soon as thematic elements enter the concepts,
                        Genette argues that they become historically variable. Only in this form, in
                        combining formal and thematic elements and in pointing to specific historical
                        conventions, should they be called “genres” (<span class="w3-tooltip w3-border-bottom w3-border-blue-grey">Genette 2014, 210, 213<span class="w3-text w3-tag w3-round w3-blue-grey w3-left-align w3-padding w3-large" style="position:absolute;left:0;bottom:25px">Genette, Gérard. 2014. “The Architext.” In <em>Modern
                                 Genre Theory</em>, edited by David Duff, 210–218. New York: Routledge.</span></span>). Even so, to do justice
                        to the importance of the three major genres, lyric, epic, and drama, and the
                        prominent status that they had in the history of literature, Genette calls them
                        “archigenres”: 
                        <blockquote>
                           <em>Archi-</em>, because each of them is supposed to overarch and
                           include, ranked by degree of importance, a certain number of empirical
                           genres that – whatever their amplitude, longevity, or potential for
                           recurrence – are apparently phenomena of culture and history; but still
                           (or already) <em>-genres</em>, because (as we have seen) their
                           defining criteria always involve a thematic element that eludes purely
                           formal or linguistic description.

                        novel or the comedy, which can be subdivided further into “species”, a concept
                        which is comparable to subgenres, “with no limit set a priori to this series of

                           species and all subgenres, genres, or supergenres are empirical classes,
                           established by observation of the historical facts or, if need be, by
                           extrapolation from those facts – that is, by a deductive activity
                           superimposed on an initial activity that is always inductive and

                        literary-theoretical positions on the other, the semiotic models of genres and
                        generic terms as elaborated, for example, by Raible and Schaeffer can be
                        located on a middle position regarding their systematic and historical
                        conception of genres. They are based on a theory of language and on models of
                        the discursive levels that are involved in speech acts, which forms their
                        theoretical core. History enters into this system because the meaning of signs
                        is context-dependent and changes over time. In addition, the speech act is
                        embedded into a situational context. Because there are a speaker and a hearer,
                        or an author and a reader, not only the linguistic but also the
                        extra-linguistic context becomes relevant, although this aspect is not the
                        primary concern of the semiotic approaches.</p>

                        of contemporary or historical texts and has, therefore, a strong empirical
                        foundation. Historical realizations of literary works are at the center of
                        digital text analysis. Para-textual and extra-textual factors are often
                        included in an analysis as metadata. For example, genre labels of different
                        proveniences are included, as well as biographic information about the works’
                        authors, information about how the works have been received and valued by
                        contemporaries or literary critics, or details about the sources of the texts
                        and their publishing (when were the works published, where and by whom?).
                        However, a broader or closer consideration of the literary and
                        extra-literary-historical context is usually not pursued as part of the
                        quantitative digital genre analysis itself. One example is Underwood, who
                        places his analysis of detective, science fiction, and Gothic novels in the
                        context of the history of reception. He uses basic bibliographic metadata to do
                        so, but not entire historical documents, which could serve to reconstruct how
                        the works in question and the genres they are associated with were received in
                        their time (<span class="w3-tooltip w3-border-bottom w3-border-blue-grey">Underwood 2016, 2,

                        is used, and if genre assignments are the target categories, they need to be
                        formulated as compact terms. However, the idea of relating the analysis of the
                        texts to how they were received in terms of genre historically is there. In
                        most corpus-based analyses, though, no shifts in the relationship between
                        generic terms and texts are analyzed, but one specific synchronic view. The
                        synchronic view may either be based on scholarly and librarian classifications,
                        on those made by contemporary readers, publishing houses, or booksellers, or on
                        labels found on historical editions of the texts.<sup id="ftn50" class="w3-btn w3-theme-l3 w3-circle" onclick="document.getElementById('ftn50-modal').style.display='block'">50</sup> The first group of contemporary labels thus leads to an
                        analysis of how today’s genre concepts relate to the style of historical texts
                        and, depending on the kind of textual material that is analyzed –
                        twentieth-century or seventeenth-century texts, for instance – the contexts of
                        production and reception are quite different. In the latter case of using
                        historical genre labels, a specific historical section of the literary field is
                        analyzed, and the contexts of the texts themselves and their generic
                        categorization are congruent. Even if the historical development of genre
                        concepts is not explicitly modeled from the point of view of reception over
                        time, quantitative genre stylistic analyses are likely to involve different
                        relationships between genre labels and texts, especially if the corpora are
                        very large and comprise texts of one long or of several literary-historical
                        periods. In the end, macroanalytic and, thus also, diachronic studies are
                        enabled by the availability of a huge number of literary texts in digital
                        format.<sup id="ftn51" class="w3-btn w3-theme-l3 w3-circle" onclick="document.getElementById('ftn51-modal').style.display='block'">51</sup></p>

                        historical concepts of genre. An important question is whether one can speak of
                        literary genres in the same sense for the text groups constituted or
                        characterized by digital text analyses as is done in traditional literary genre
                        studies. This thesis argues that literary theory's notions of genre are not
                        directly transferable to digital genre stylistics, and that the field needs its
                        own conceptual set with which to meaningfully describe its questions, methods,
                        and results. Such a conceptual set also has the task of clarifying the
                        relationship to existing concepts from other fields, that is, especially
                        literary studies, linguistics, computational linguistics, and computer science.
                        In the following, existing conceptual systems on textual and communicative,
                        theoretical and historical dimensions of genre are discussed, and a conceptual
                        system of our own for digital genre stylistics is proposed.</p>

                        <p id="p60"><span class="paracount w3-blue-grey w3-margin-right"><a href="#p60">60</a></span>In digital genre stylistics, it has sometimes been proposed
                           that one should not speak about the analysis of “genres” in this case, but
                           of “text types”. This is because of the focus of digital genre stylistics on
                           the literary texts themselves and more specifically on their linguistic
                           surface and style, and the relatively limited inclusion of information that
                           is related to the literary-historical and social context. At the same time,
                           genre is a concept that appears to be strongly influenced also by
                           extra-textual historical factors. On the one hand, the terminological
                           distinction between genres and text types has its origin in linguistics,
                           where literary genres are differentiated from linguistic text types. On the
                           other hand it has also been proposed in literary genre theory itself as a
                           means of distinguishing between genres that are based purely on textual and
                           linguistic criteria and historical genres. This is similar to Genette’s
                           proposal to differentiate between <em>mode</em> and <em>genre</em>.
                           In the context of text linguistics, text types (in German, “Texttypen”) are
                           described as follows: 
                           <blockquote>

                              in verschiedenen Kommunikationsbereichen. Als linguistische Kriterien
                              gelten dabei textinterne Merkmale (Merkmale der Textinfrastruktur) wie
                              Stil (Stiltyp, z.B. Ironie, Nominalstil), Medialität (medialer Typ,
                              z.B. digitaler Text, konzeptionell mündlicher Text), Textfunktion auf
                              der Basis sprachlicher Indikatoren (Funktionstyp, z.B. Kontakttext),

                           These two uses of the term “text type” should thus not be confused. The
                           terminological differentiation between pragmatically determined text types
                           and syntactically and semantically distinguishable ones is also recognized
                           in computational linguistics, where it is labeled as the opposition between
                           genres and text types. It is probably through this influence that the
                           conceptual separation between genres and text types has also been taken up
                           in digital genre stylistics. In his computational study of linguistic genre
                           variation, Biber, for example, declares: 
                           <blockquote>
                              I have used the term ‘genre’ (or ‘register’) for text varieties
                              that are readily recognized and ‘named’ within a culture (e.g.,
                              letters, press editorials, sermons, conversation), while I have used
                              the term ‘text type’ for varieties that are defined linguistically
                              (rather than perceptually). Both genres and text types can be
                              characterized by reference to co-occuring linguistic features, but
                              text types are further defined quantitatively such that the texts in a
                              type all share frequent use of the same set of co-occurring linguistic
                              features. Because co-occurrence reflects shared function, the
                              resulting types are coherent in their linguistic form and
                              communicative functions.

                           functions. Biber finds five dimensions of variation (informational versus

                           expect (as Biber) or require (Kessler, Numberg, and Schütze) that some
                           common formal elements can be found for texts that have been associated with

                           the distinction between genres and text types focuses on the differences
                           between conventional and pragmatic characteristics on the one side and
                           structural linguistic features of text groups on the other side. In literary
                           genre theory, in contrast, the point of debate in this terminological
                           question is more oriented towards the systematic versus historical nature of
                           the objects. Fricke, for instance, argues that it is not necessary to
                           abandon neither the function of generic terms as names for historical groups
                           nor their use as classificatory terms but that they should be distinguished.
                           He differentiates a “literary text type” (“literarische Textsorte”) from a
                           “genre” and defines the first one as a purely systematic term to categorize
                           literary texts and the latter as a term for historically bound and delimited
                           literary institutions. To determine if a text belongs to a text type, its
                           grammatical, semantic, and textual-pragmatic functions must be analyzed
                           (<span class="w3-tooltip w3-border-bottom w3-border-blue-grey">Fricke 1981, 132–133<span class="w3-text w3-tag w3-round w3-blue-grey w3-left-align w3-padding w3-large" style="position:absolute;left:0;bottom:25px">Fricke, Harald. 1981. <em>Norm und Abweichung. Eine

                           According to Fricke, more criteria need to be fulfilled in order to
                           attribute a text to a genre. First, the text needs to conform to a clearly
                           distinguishable literary text type. Second, the literary text type has to be
                           established in the national literature of the text in question when the text
                           is created, so that it corresponds to the expectations that contemporary
                           readers have regarding the characteristics of the literary text type. Third,
                           the text needs to explicitly carry an established name of the literary text
                           type or exhibit other established signals for it. Finally, Fricke also uses
                           the term “Gattung” (German for “genre”) as a general term that can be used
                           to both designate literary text types, genres, or any other establishment of
                           groups of literary texts (<span class="w3-tooltip w3-border-bottom w3-border-blue-grey">Fricke
                              1981, 132<span class="w3-text w3-tag w3-round w3-blue-grey w3-left-align w3-padding w3-large" style="position:absolute;left:0;bottom:25px">Fricke, Harald. 1981. <em>Norm und Abweichung. Eine
                                    Philosophie der Literatur.</em> München: Beck.</span></span>). Fricke’s proposal to speak of literary text types is
                           fruitful for cases in which literary texts are classified based on
                           syntactic, semantic, and pragmatic linguistic properties or any other
                           textual characteristics without establishing any direct connection to a
                           specific historical genre discourse. This use of the term “text type” is
                           congruent with the definition of “Texttyp” in general linguistics and “text
                           type” as used by Biber. However, Fricke’s definition of “genre” is very
                           strict. According to his concept, genres are a subset of the text types that
                           they correspond to, because a common text type is a prerequisite. In
                           addition, the text type has to correspond to contemporary expectations,
                           which means that only generic conventions that are realized as
                           distinguishable text types actually represent genres. Fricke does not say
                           how he would call generic expectations or norms that are not mappable to
                           specific combinations of textual features in a consistent way. Moreover,
                           distinctions of literary genres made after the text’s creation, whose
                           participation in a genre is analyzed, are not called genres if the genre
                           concept had not been established before. For example, the <em>gaucho
                              novel</em> would not be a genre of nineteenth-century Spanish-American
                           novels if it could not be verified that the term or the concept already
                           existed as a norm that was conscious to the historical authors, publishers,
                           readers, and critics. Furthermore, texts that are similar to others because
                           of linguistic criteria but do not carry explicit or established implicit
                           generic signals would also be considered as not participating in a genre. It
                           makes sense not to assume a common genre simply because of textual
                           similarities – one could, for example, find similar verse structures in the
                           poetry of different centuries and continents by accident, for which no
                           historical relationship could be verified. Nevertheless, if a text was
                           created in the same context as a group of other texts that carry an explicit
                           genre name and they all share textual features, one might argue that the
                           non-labeled text also participates in the genre. Determining where the same
                           context begins or ends is another question that needs to be solved. One can
                           also not exclude the possibility of cases of generic references spanning
                           different temporal, geographical, or linguistic contexts, even if this is
                           not the usual case. A wider definition of genre would be more appropriate
                           for the purpose of digital genre stylistics. Such a definition should be
                           able to relate conventional or critically established generic groupings of
                           different kinds with findings of groups on the textual level without
                           restricting the kinds or relationships.</p>
                        
                        <p id="p65"><span class="paracount w3-blue-grey w3-margin-right"><a href="#p65">65</a></span>Examining Fricke’s definition of genre further and following
                           his explanations, even his definition of text types appears too narrow for
                           digital genre stylistics. In requiring the congruence of texts that share
                           the features of a certain text type and that belong to a certain genre
                           convention, Fricke already assumes that the text types are linked to generic
                           expectations. Any arbitrary text classification could not be expected to be
                           congruent with the genre concepts if not by accident. Thus Fricke requires a
                           precise and systematic definition of a text type that can serve as a
                           starting point for an empirical study that aims to verify if the text type
                           was institutionalized as a genre in some historical period (<span class="w3-tooltip w3-border-bottom w3-border-blue-grey">Fricke 1981, 133<span class="w3-text w3-tag w3-round w3-blue-grey w3-left-align w3-padding w3-large" style="position:absolute;left:0;bottom:25px">Fricke, Harald. 1981. <em>Norm und Abweichung.

                           types should not be defined arbitrarily but according to their scholarly
                           appropriateness: “Um ihrer heuristischen Eignung willen wird man die

                           historisch belegte Texte zutreffen und daß nach Möglichkeit sogar irgendwann

                           text types beforehand that probably correspond to historical genres requires
                           a deductive procedure starting from assumed prior definitions of these
                           genres. As was already discussed in the previous chapter, digital genre
                           analyses can be conducted in a number of different ways: they can start with
                           the formulation of theoretically based hypotheses about genres, which are
                           then formalized, but they can also start from genre labels that stand for
                           conventional ideas of genres and directly test if and how they relate to
                           textual characteristics, without following a continuous chain of formalizing
                           steps. The hypotheses about the relevance of specific textual features for
                           genres can be quite loose. A strength of the computational approaches is
                           specifically that series of different hypotheses can be tested and also that
                           unforeseen results can be achieved through experimentation. In many cases,
                           the formalization of literary concepts is not so mature that it would allow
                           for continuous deductive procedures. Consequently, text types found through
                           digital stylistic analyses do not necessarily have to be in line with
                           literary-theoretical text types or historical genres. Rather, what can be
                           looked for are the points of intersection between generic conventions and
                           groups established based on textual features. They can be approximated to
                           each other, but it should not be expected that they depend on each other or
                           that there is a relationship of inclusion between them. I propose to widen
                           the understanding of genre, but in turn to differentiate between two kinds
                           of genres to establish a connection to text types. For the purpose of
                           digital genre stylistics, as it is conducted in this dissertation, the
                           following working definitions are proposed:

                                 term used to designate groups of literary texts that are established
                                 on the basis of common or similar immanent textual features and
                                 feature distributions of any kind and that can be distinguished from
                                 other literary text types based on these features and feature
                                 distributions.</li>

                                 “conventional” is used in a broad sense here and refers to historical

                                 how texts are to be systematically assigned to genres, e.g., by
                                 librarians or literary scholars, because considered on a large scale
                                 and across time, systematic approaches are also historically

                              <li>A <em>textual literary genre</em> is the convergence or
                                 intersection of a conventional literary genre and a literary text
                                 type. A literary text type and a conventional genre can be congruent
                                 to a certain degree, depending on the extent to which the groups of
                                 texts participating in them coincide. If the perspective starts from
                                 the conventional genre, it may be <em>textually coherent</em> to a
                                 certain degree. This means that a certain percentage of the texts that
                                 are attributed to the conventional genre are also part of a
                                 corresponding text type. With a correspondence of more than 50&nbsp;%, one
                                 can speak of a certain textual coherence of the conventional genre. A
                                 text can participate in several conventional genres, and it can also
                                 belong to several text types. As a consequence, a text can be
                                 associated with no, one, or several textual genres.</li>
                              </ul>

                        <p id="p66"><span class="paracount w3-blue-grey w3-margin-right"><a href="#p66">66</a></span>In what follows, these determinations are explained and
                           justified in more detail. With the differentiation between conventional and
                           textual literary genres, the genres can be both detached from specific
                           textual features or linked to them. To find out about the textual literary
                           genres in which literary text types and conventional literary genres overlap
                           is then a central task of digital genre stylistics. All kinds of
                           relationships between conventional genres and text types can be assumed. For
                           example, an extreme case would be a generic norm that has been discussed in
                           poetological writings and can be described as a conventional literary genre,
                           but that has never been realized on a textual level through a set of
                           literary works. At the other extreme would be a text type that is
                           recognizable in terms of recurrent patterns of feature distributions and
                           that can be distinguished from other text types based on these features, but
                           that has never been named or discussed as a conventional genre. Between
                           these two extreme cases, many other constellations are possible, for
                           example, groups of texts that carry signals of a particular conventional
                           genre but of which only a part is coherent on the textual level. Another
                           possible case is a conventional genre, which is held together by a common
                           name but which relates to several different text types so that it can be
                           described as several different textual genres. Such a result could stimulate
                           further investigation into the conventional genre to see if there are signs
                           of several subtypes.<sup id="ftn52" class="w3-btn w3-theme-l3 w3-circle" onclick="document.getElementById('ftn52-modal').style.display='block'">52</sup> Also possible are cases where
                           two different conventional genres relate to the same text type. For example,
                           it could be analyzed if different terms of shorter narrative prose in the
                           Spanish-American nineteenth-century tradition that do not seem to be limited
                           very clearly as conventional genres (“narración”, “relato”, “cuento”,
                           “novelita”) have a common textual basis. Three of the many possible
                           constellations between text types, conventional genres, and textual genres
                           are illustrated schematically in <a href="#fig1">figure

                           genre and a text type overlap to a certain degree so that one textual genre
                           can be identified. The parts of the conventional genre that lie outside the
                           textual genre refer to literary texts that have been marked as being part of
                           the convention but that do not conform to the text type. On the other hand,
                           there are texts whose characteristics correspond to the text type but that
                           have not been assigned to the conventional genre. In the three examples
                           shown in the figure, there is no relationship of inclusion between the
                           conventional genre and the text type, but this would, of course, also be
                           possible. In such a case, all the literary texts that conform to the text
                           type could also be part of the conventional genre, only that some other
                           texts that are associated with the conventional genre are not congruent with
                           the text type (inclusion of the text type in the conventional genre), or all
                           the texts that participate in the conventional genre are in line with the
                           text type, and, in addition, there are texts that fulfill the criteria of
                           the text type but that have not been marked as belonging to the genre by
                           convention (inclusion of the conventional genre in the text type). The
                           second case in the middle of the figure illustrates a relationship of
                           overlap between one conventional genre and two different text types, so that
                           two textual genres are identified. In such a setting, it is conceivable that
                           one genre name is used for different text types that can be distinguished
                           either synchronically or diachronically. The third case to the right shows
                           how two conventional genres, which are, for example, characterized by two
                           different genre names, can be covered by the same text type. Here, too,
                           there result two different textual genres. An example of this constellation
                           would be if the same textual characteristics are found in different
                           historical contexts and different genre names are used in these contexts to
                           refer to them. In the schematic cases shown here, only up to two
                           conventional genres or text types are involved, but there could, of course,
                           also be scenarios where more parts are involved.</p>
                        
                        <p id="p68"><span class="paracount w3-blue-grey w3-margin-right"><a href="#p68">68</a></span>What is the status of generic signals that relate literary
                           works to genres in this setup? Explicit genre names, implicit textual genre
                           signals such as conventionalized titles or names, or beginnings of the
                           texts<sup id="ftn53" class="w3-btn w3-theme-l3 w3-circle" onclick="document.getElementById('ftn53-modal').style.display='block'">53</sup> are understood as belonging to the level of
                           conventional genres. The presence of such signals does not necessarily mean
                           that a text conforms to a specific textual genre, and even their absence
                           does not mean that a text cannot be described in terms of the same text type
                           that is connected to a textual genre. An unconventional use of generic
                           signals, for example, a subversive or an ironic one, can be detected when
                           there is a discrepancy between the individual text carrying the signal and
                           other members of a textual genre.</p>
                        
                        <p id="p69"><span class="paracount w3-blue-grey w3-margin-right"><a href="#p69">69</a></span>A question that needs to be addressed is how assignments of
                           literary texts to genres that are not established by paratextual or textual
                           signals but text-externally relate to the three terms defined above. Part of
                           this question is how generic terms and definitions of genres, on the one
                           hand, and the text types, conventional, and textual genres, on the other
                           hand, behave in relation to the literary system, literary theory, and
                           literary history. As Schaeffer notes: “les termes génériques on un status
                           bâtard. Ils ne sont pas de purs terms analytiques qu’on appliquerait de
                           l’extérieur à l’histoire des textes, mais font, à des degrés divers, partie
                           de cette histoire même” (<span class="w3-tooltip w3-border-bottom w3-border-blue-grey">Schaeffer 1983, 65<span class="w3-text w3-tag w3-round w3-blue-grey w3-left-align w3-padding w3-large" style="position:absolute;left:0;bottom:25px">Schaeffer, Jean-Marie. 1983. <em>Qu’est-ce qu’un
                                    genre littéraire?</em> Paris: Seuil.</span></span>). What Schaeffer means is that also terms that
                           are defined externally are part of the history of genres. Very important is
                           his remark that generic terms do so to <em>different degrees</em>.
                           Furthermore, the degree also depends on the perspective. If a
                           nineteenth-century Mexican editor labels several books that are published
                           for the first time as “novelas”, he applies this term collectively to
                           several works. He thus has an understanding of the genre that already
                           involves a systematic element – he compares the books to his concept of the
                           genre <em>novela</em> and decides if they fit into the category or not.
                           However, if we analyze these nineteenth-century novels today, we perceive
                           the editor’s decisions as part of the history of the genre and his opinion
                           as formed by the convention of the time. The labels would therefore be signs
                           of the conventional genre. In addition, the understanding that an editor has
                           of a genre is probably not much formed by theoretical considerations. If,
                           instead, a contemporary writer expresses his views on what the
                           <em>novela</em> is in poetic terms and lists several works that
                           conform to his definition of the genre, this, too, would represent a
                           systematic and possibly also theoretically motivated approach to the
                           genre.<sup id="ftn54" class="w3-btn w3-theme-l3 w3-circle" onclick="document.getElementById('ftn54-modal').style.display='block'">54</sup> To his or her contemporaries, the initiative could
                           appear as not being part of the genre convention but rather as an attempt to
                           define a textual genre. For the literary historian, again, it would clearly
                           contribute to the genre convention of the time, even if the historical,
                           poetic definition of the genre is by degree more systematic and theoretical
                           than the practice of individual writers or editors who provide the texts
                           that they write or publish with generic labels. Yet another case is that of
                           a modern librarian who classifies historical texts by genre. If one
                           librarian does this, a unique concept of the genre (the one the librarian
                           has) is applied collectively to a set of texts. If several librarians
                           classify the texts together, multiple genre concepts are involved.<sup id="ftn55" class="w3-btn w3-theme-l3 w3-circle" onclick="document.getElementById('ftn55-modal').style.display='block'">55</sup> The labeling that the librarians do is not
                           part of the historical genre convention of the context in which the literary
                           texts were initially created and published. Instead, it is part of the
                           modern genre convention, even if that convention has a systematic background
                           and is informed by literary studies. This is the more obvious the more
                           different people participate in applying a specific concept of genre.
                           Finally, literary-theoretical or literary-historical positions
                           <em>can</em> also be perceived as conventional if they are analyzed
                           collectively. When the genre assignments of twenty different literary
                           scholars are examined together, it is not very probable that they all share
                           the exact same theoretical understanding of the genres in question. The sum
                           of their judgments constitutes itself a theoretically based genre
                           convention. Conventional genres can thus involve a systematic and
                           theoretical element.<sup id="ftn56" class="w3-btn w3-theme-l3 w3-circle" onclick="document.getElementById('ftn56-modal').style.display='block'">56</sup> The more
                           weight that systematic and theoretical element has, the more probable it is
                           that the genre convention largely correlates with a text type. On the other
                           side, historical poetical genre definitions as well as modern literary
                           theoretical ones could also be understood as theoretical entities and be
                           used as hypotheses about textual genres. They could then be tested by
                           applying them to the texts that have been classified as instances of the
                           genres based on the respective genre definitions.<sup id="ftn57" class="w3-btn w3-theme-l3 w3-circle" onclick="document.getElementById('ftn57-modal').style.display='block'">57</sup> Just as genre conventions are not
                           understood as purely historical, also text types are not conceived as purely
                           systematic or theoretical entities here. Whenever text types are derived
                           from a corpus of literary texts, they involve a historical element because
                           the texts were produced in a specific historical setting. Following
                           Hempfer’s assumption that generic norms and expectations enter literary
                           texts and are readable from them as normative facts, the conventional genres
                           influence the text types. Otherwise, there would not be any textual genres
                           at all. More distant to the historical genre conventions are text types that
                           are defined on general theoretical principles without recourse to specific
                           text corpora, for example, text types that are formulated according to a
                           general theory of language or literature. Similar to theoretically defined
                           genres, these could be used as testable hypotheses with regard to literary
                           text types, i.e. to check to what extent they represent actual textual
                           patterns. When such theoretical text types also refer to generic
                           conventions, they are theories about textual genres. That is, theories of
                           literary textual genres can be more inclined towards genre conventions – if
                           they concentrate on historically bound discursive expectations towards
                           literary texts and relate them to textual characteristics – or they can be
                           inclined towards text types if they start from systematic definitions of
                           text groups and relate them to conventional generic terms.</p>

                              because one cannot study a large archive in the same way one studies
                              as text: texts are designed to ‘speak’ to us [...] &nbsp;but archives [...]
                              say absolutely nothing until one asks the right question. [...] it

                              Difficult; but too interesting not to give it a try.

                           constituted to match historical genre conventions in the best way and by not
                           demanding a relationship of inclusion between text types and conventional
                           genres, experiments with different kinds of textual features are possible
                           and can lead to new insights about textual genres. One possible analysis
                           scenario is outlined here: 
                           <ul>
                              
                              <li>generic labels for the texts in a corpus are collected from
                                 different modern library catalogs</li>
                              
                              <li>a most frequent words-based classification is used to find out how
                                 well the texts can be classified by the genre labels</li>
                              
                              <li>it is determined which features are most important for the textual
                                 distinction between the different genres.</li>
                              </ul> In this scenario, the goal is to work out the degree of textual
                           coherence of the conventional genres and to define the text types underlying
                           the textual genres based on a general set of linguistic features. Texts that
                           are repeatedly misclassified can be assumed to be part of the genre
                           convention to which they were assigned but not of the textual genre to which
                           the genre label in question is primarily attributed. If such texts are
                           assigned to another class several times by the classifier, it can be checked
                           if they are described better by another text type.</p>
                        
                        <p id="p72"><span class="paracount w3-blue-grey w3-margin-right"><a href="#p72">72</a></span>However, the distinction between literary text types,
                           conventional genres, and textual genres does not only allow for testing how
                           relevant certain general textual features are to capture the connections
                           between the levels of text and convention. On the other hand, one can as
                           well start from theories of textual genres. Such an analysis scenario is
                           sketched here as an example. For instance, it would be possible to depart
                           from a definition of the historical novel as a novel that is characterized
                           by 
                           <ul>
                              
                              <li>the temporal distance between the writing, publication, and
                                 reception of the novel and the past in which the narrated events take
                                 place,</li>
                              
                              <li>the co-occurrence of invented and historical personages, places,
                                 and events,</li>
                              
                              <li>and the localization of the narrated events in a precise historical
                                 past.<sup id="ftn58" class="w3-btn w3-theme-l3 w3-circle" onclick="document.getElementById('ftn58-modal').style.display='block'">58</sup></li>
                              </ul> A specific corpus of historical and non-historical novels could be
                           built by using specific kinds of genre labels, for example, indications of
                           the subgenre on book covers. These then function as markers of the
                           conventional genre against which the definition of the textual genre is
                           checked.<sup id="ftn59" class="w3-btn w3-theme-l3 w3-circle" onclick="document.getElementById('ftn59-modal').style.display='block'">59</sup> It would then be necessary to formalize the elements
                           that are part of the literary theoretical definition. In this case, it would
                           not be enough to just use the most frequent words because the deductive
                           chain from the genre definition to the textual features needs to be
                           maintained. Instead, named entity recognition could be used to detect the
                           mention of historical figures in the novels, combined with their
                           identification through authority files. The detection of temporal
                           expressions with temporal taggers could be used to check if the historical
                           novels are characterized by more frequent uses of explicit temporal
                           expressions than other subgenres of the novel that are represented in the
                           corpus. As a result, it could be verified how many of the novels that were
                           marked as historical novels by convention are captured with the text type
                           that is derived from the theoretical definition of the textual genre. In
                           this case, a challenge would be to quantify the boundaries between
                           historical and non-historical novels based on the literary theoretical
                           criteria and to find a way to delimit the text type. This is because the
                           criteria are <em>positively</em> formulated and refer to the
                           <em>presence</em> of features (for example, “there <em>is</em> a
                           temporal distance between the publication date of the novel and the narrated
                           past”). However, it is not said how much of the feature should be present
                           (how large should the temporal distance be? 20 years, or 50, or hundreds of
                           years?) and how the same features are distributed in texts that are part of
                           other genres (are they totally absent there – no temporal distance at all –
                           or just less frequent or less strong – only up to 10 years of temporal
                           distance?). This example shows how difficult it can be to directly map
                           literary theoretical assumptions about genres to a digital quantitative
                           genre analysis. In the above example, possible strategies could be to
                           cluster the texts based on the chosen features and, if several clusters can
                           be clearly distinguished in the data, to interpret them as text types. It
                           could then be checked on which feature ranges and distributions these text
                           types are based and where the boundaries between them are in terms of
                           feature values. In a next step, it could be analyzed how the texts
                           associated with the conventional genres are spread over the different
                           clusters to see if the theoretical assumptions about the relevance of the
                           three text characteristics for the distinction of historical from
                           non-historical novels on a textual level hold. Still, at least two problems
                           would persist in this case. The first problem is the one of
                           underspecification of the assumptions. How can the theory of the historical
                           novel be confirmed or rejected if the decisions about quantifying the
                           definition’s different parts are part of the analysis results but not part
                           of its starting point? One could always say that the theory may be valid or
                           invalid for other quantifications. If not to confirm or reject a specific
                           definition of a textual genre, the results of the quantitative analysis
                           could still be used to refine the theory by providing the specification of
                           its assumptions in numerical terms. The second problem that persists is that
                           it would be necessary to define a limit for the ratio of conventional
                           historical or non-historical novels that must be present in the found text
                           types in order to say that the text types correlate with the conventional
                           genres. It is implausible that 100&nbsp;% of the novels with the conventional
                           label “historical” would end up in the same cluster and none of them in the
                           other(s). Is 90&nbsp;% enough to say that the theory is adequate for the corpus
                           at hand and describes the textual genre satisfactorily, or is just 60&nbsp;%
                           enough or only 51&nbsp;%? The same problem would remain if classification was
                           used instead of clustering. Again, instead of confirming or rejecting the
                           hypotheses entirely, the results could be used to describe the extent of the
                           intersection between the conventional genre and the text type.</p>

                           between literary text types, conventional genres, and textual genres for a
                           corpus-based digital genre analysis aiming to mediate between genre
                           conventions and text characteristics. It is important to clarify and explain
                           several aspects of the data and the analysis:

                              <li>and the modeling of factors other than genre that are assumed to
                                 have an influence on the distribution of textual features.</li>
                              </ul> These requirements are, in essence, not different for a non-digital,
                           non-quantitative, and non-stylistic analysis of genres, but the ways in
                           which they can be addressed are different. In quantitative text analysis, a
                           genre is determined by contrasting and distinguishing texts associated with
                           it from other texts – otherwise, the analysis would concentrate on the
                           internal structures of the genre but not on its defining characteristics.
                           Consequently, a corpus for the analysis of a specific genre always contains
                           also texts that are not assumed to participate in that genre. This can
                           facilitate the text selection because what has to be defined is the initial
                           broader context of the genre. For example, an analysis aiming to find out
                           about seventeenth-century tragedies can rely on a corpus of
                           seventeenth-century dramatic texts, including comedies, tragicomedies, and
                           other dramatic subgenres. Therefore, it is not all-decisive which texts
                           exactly are assumed to be associated with the genre of interest at the
                           outset of the analysis. A prior definition of the genre that is to be
                           determined by the text analysis is not mandatory. Instead, the extension of
                           the genre can be approached by collecting texts that are similar to the
                           object of interest. In the case of the tragedies, these would be texts that
                           were written and published in the same historical period, and that
                           participate in the same major genre. What is important, though, is to
                           remember that any delimitation of a textual genre that results from such a
                           corpus-based contrastive analysis is relative to the texts that are part of
                           the text collection but are not considered instances of the genre. If the
                           tragedies are only compared to comedies, they are determined as
                           non-comedies. This means that the problem of genre definition is relocated
                           to a more general level, by selecting the wider context of texts in which
                           instances of the textual genre of interest are assumed to be found.
                           <em>Inside</em> the contextual text collection, the search for
                           intersections between conventional genres and text types, and thereby the
                           definition of textual genres, is possible, and its results are not
                           predetermined.</p>

                           of assignment of genre labels to the texts in the collection transparent is
                           crucial if the digital stylistic analysis aims to contribute to existing
                           literary-historical research and if it seeks to find out about genres and
                           not only text types. For very large corpora, assigning genre labels by hand
                           may be unfeasible. One option is to use available bibliographic sources in
                           digital format that are processable with scripts and to collect genre labels
                           automatically. Even if labels are assigned individually and manually to the
                           works, it is often necessary to rely on several sources. Single sources
                           usually do not cover all the texts in a corpus, so different kinds of genre
                           conventions may be involved. For example, the genre labels can originate
                           from scholarly handbooks or library catalogs, thus involving two different
                           kinds of systematic approaches to the genres. Even if several sources are
                           used, it is probable that there remain texts of the broader context whose
                           generic status cannot be clarified beforehand, for instance, if they have
                           not been in the focus of scholarly, librarian, or public attention at all.
                           To what extent historical labels can be used depends on the availability of
                           historical editions and book covers. Because the use of large corpora makes
                           it more difficult to pursue a uniform strategy for genre assignments, it is
                           even more important to set out in detail how the task was solved and to
                           discuss the consequences for the textual genre that is determined in the
                           analysis.</p>
                        
                        <p id="p75"><span class="paracount w3-blue-grey w3-margin-right"><a href="#p75">75</a></span>As the text types in digital genre analyses are determined
                           through text style, it is important to model factors which influence it, and
                           this is also connected to the question of corpus building. Ultimately, the
                           goal is not just to find arbitrary text types but to delimit textual genres
                           in which textual similarities and communicative generic norms converge. How
                           to find out if the facts found in the texts actually represent normative
                           facts that are due to genre conventions and not traces of other intra- or
                           extra-textual factors? Every genre analysis, a stylistic and also a
                           non-stylistic one, has to make sure that the text corpus does not only
                           consist of texts written by one or a few authors so that the claims built on
                           the corpus analysis are not only about individual authors but about the
                           genre. The issue is, however, more complicated in a stylistic analysis
                           because all characteristics of the texts that are taken into account,
                           modeled, or found lead to the text style or are derived from it. For
                           instance, authorship can be primarily marked by a certain authorial style,
                           and that style can be captured through the analysis of high-frequency words.
                           Yet, the same words can also be properties that give evidence of some
                           higher-order structural concept. For example, the type of narrator that is
                           used in a narrative text can influence the number of specific personal
                           pronouns. There can also be properties that are related to the textual
                           genre, for instance, many general descriptive passages in novels of customs,
                           which lead to a comparatively higher number of undetermined articles. To
                           make sure that it is the genre convention that is captured with the overlap
                           of genre labels and text types, it is, therefore, necessary to control and
                           check possible interfering factors in the text style by modeling them as
                           metadata and considering them in the process of text selection.</p>

                           with the systematic or historical status of text types and genres. In <a href="ch2.html#ch2.1.2.1">chapter 2.1.2.1</a> above, there
                           was a focus on semiotic theories of genres and on generic terms. How can
                           these models be understood in connection with text types, conventional
                           genres, and textual genres? When they are used to analyze historical generic
                           terms, they approach these with a language-based, communicative theory to
                           find out which levels of discourse the terms address. This means that the
                           norms that a conventional genre involves are described as characteristics of
                           texts as speech acts. Following Raible’s model, for example, the subgenre
                           <em>novela documentaria</em> would point to the level of the
                           relationship between text and reality (a documenting activity purports that
                           reality is depicted) and the level of the kind of linguistic representation
                           (a documentary style is likely to be neutral and descriptive). These
                           characteristics can be taken as hypotheses about the text types that relate
                           to the conventional genres and thereby also as hypotheses about the features
                           of textual genres, considering that for a stylistic analysis, all these
                           hypotheses would have to be broken down to the level of linguistic
                           representation. Furthermore, the semiotic models of genre constitute a
                           possibility to differentiate between the various discursive levels on which
                           sets of genres are defined, which can help to define more meaningful
                           comparisons of genres. In the case of the novel, for instance, there is a
                           wealth of subgenres, some of which emphasize similar aspects of speech acts
                           and others entirely different ones. The more different the discursive levels
                           are that the generic terms point to, the more probable it is that also the
                           corresponding textual genres are defined on different levels, that the
                           groups of texts associated with the genre conventions overlap, and also that
                           the generic conventions might be different in kind. For example, it seems
                           useful to compare sentimental novels to historical novels if both are
                           interpreted as being defined primarily on a thematic level. On the other
                           hand, it is less fruitful to directly contrast sentimental and romantic
                           novels because the latter often (but not always) have a sentimental theme.
                           In addition, the label “romantic” points to a certain aesthetic movement
                           that was dominant in a specific period of time and not necessarily to
                           thematic elements. This is not to say that sentimental or historical novels
                           are only defined thematically, only that comparing these subgenres makes the
                           most sense on a discursive level that is a prominent reference point for
                           both.</p>

                           understand how the semiotic approach to genre relates to the three terms of
                           text type, conventional genre, and textual genre proposed here. In the last
                           part of his book “Qu’est-ce qu’un genre littéraire?”, he discusses generic
                           regimes and logics, by which he means the kinds of relationships that
                           individual texts have with “their genre”, and how these regimes are
                           connected to the generic names (<span class="w3-tooltip w3-border-bottom w3-border-blue-grey">Schaeffer 1983, 156<span class="w3-text w3-tag w3-round w3-blue-grey w3-left-align w3-padding w3-large" style="position:absolute;left:0;bottom:25px">Schaeffer, Jean-Marie. 1983. <em>Qu’est-ce qu’un
                                    genre littéraire?</em> Paris: Seuil.</span></span>). Basically, he
                           distinguishes between the relationships of <em>exemplification</em> and
                           <em>modulation</em>. By exemplification, he means that texts
                           instantiate genres globally (the whole text as a communicational act
                           represents the genre, and not only parts of it) and without modifying the
                           genre itself (the text is only an example of the genre, the genre stays the
                           same). The discursive level to which generic names refer in such cases is
                           the communicational act. In that case, the genre is not defined in textual
                           (syntactic and semantic) terms but in pragmatic ones, concerned with the
                           discursive attitude and the global intention. The type of convention that is
                           involved in such cases is a constituting one. That is, one cannot depart
                           from the convention to a certain degree but only fulfill it completely or
                           fail to do so entirely. According to Schaeffer, cases of genres that can be
                           exemplified are, for instance, drama or narration. If a literary work is
                           conceived as a drama, that is the case independently of its exact form. Even
                           if it contains narrative passages, it is still a drama, because the genre is
                           not understood as being dependent on the actual textual realization but on
                           the outer communicative level (<span class="w3-tooltip w3-border-bottom w3-border-blue-grey">Schaeffer 1983, 156–164<span class="w3-text w3-tag w3-round w3-blue-grey w3-left-align w3-padding w3-large" style="position:absolute;left:0;bottom:25px">Schaeffer, Jean-Marie. 1983. <em>Qu’est-ce qu’un
                                    genre littéraire?</em> Paris: Seuil.</span></span>). Schaeffer’s regime of exemplification is
                           a bit difficult to grasp. It seems close to the concepts of
                           <em>mode</em> and <em>Schreibweisen</em> that Todorov, Hempfer,
                           and Genette develop because it refers to basic discursive attitudes that are
                           linguistically motivated and tend to be historically invariant. However,
                           Schaeffer uses nouns and not adjectives when he refers to this type of
                           genre, and he relates the terms to literary works as a whole, which makes it
                           more challenging to differentiate the <em>genres by example</em> from
                           the historical genres. Schaeffer relates this generic regime to a
                           “constituting” convention.</p>
                        
                        <p id="p78"><span class="paracount w3-blue-grey w3-margin-right"><a href="#p78">78</a></span>The second main type of generic logic that Schaeffer describes,
                           the <em>modulation</em>, is, on the other hand, concerned with the
                           syntactic and semantic entities that texts are. As soon as these discursive
                           levels are addressed, Schaeffer claims, the relationship to the genre cannot
                           be simply exemplifying anymore. Except for the special case of exact copies,
                           each text is individual in this respect and always modifies the genre with
                           which it is associated. In the case of modulation, the determination of the
                           genre depends on the individual works and, thereby, also on the specific
                           historical context in which the works are situated. The same generic names
                           “drama” and “narration” can also be examples of the modulating logic if they
                           refer to specific textual elements such as character constellations, themes,
                           or elements of style. Schaeffer divides this regime further into

                           that are related to text types (orange), conventional genres (dark green),
                           and textual genres (light green) – no colors are used in Schaeffer’s
                           original table. Text types correspond to the logic of <em>modulation by
                              resemblance</em>, which leads to classes of similar texts that are
                           defined statistically. Schaeffer has a double line between the last row of
                           the table and the upper three ones, showing that he sees a clear difference
                           between this generic logic and the other types involving different kinds of
                           conventions. However, for the three generic logics of <em>global
                              exemplification</em>, <em>modulation by application</em>, and
                           <em>hypertextual modulation</em>, the conventional level is not
                           clearly separated from the textual level. They mainly describe how that
                           genre is constituted, for example, as a set of rules that are listed in a
                           poetic formulation of a genre and that have a prescriptive character or as a
                           heuristic description based on works that are traditionally associated with
                           a genre. The two columns “relation” and “écart” (deviation), in contrast,
                           describe to how a specific text instantiates a generic convention and how it
                           may deviate from it. They can be interpreted in terms of the textual genre –
                           as the point of contact between the text type that the text in question
                           belongs to and the conventional genre that it participates in, even if
                           Schaeffer focuses on divergence (modulation, deviation, violation,
                           transformation) rather than intersection. Nevertheless, in Schaeffer’s
                           approach, the levels of conventional genre and textual genre are
                           intertwined. On the other hand, resemblance on the textual level is seen as
                           not being related to the conventions at all, disconnecting the text types
                           from the generic conventions. If one were to transfer this view to digital
                           stylistic genre analysis, which is based on text features that are
                           statistically evaluated, this would mean that it operates in another sphere,
                           which has nothing to say about the literary-historical context of genres.
                           Against this, the initial separation of the textual from the conventional
                           level that is proposed in this study is not meant to isolate both concerns
                           but to provide a more open basis for comparison so that the connections and
                           disconnections of the two levels can be analyzed.</p>

                           phenomena that are related to literary-historical conventions can be
                           considered conventional <em>genres</em>. Is an aesthetic movement a
                           genre? Literary genre theorists have different views on this topic. Todorov,
                           for example, explicitly excludes literary movements from his concept of
                           genre, but he does so because he presupposes textual coherence for genres,
                           which according to him, cannot be expected with certainty for literary
                           movements: 
                           <blockquote>
                              Since a genre is the historically attested codification of
                              discursive properties, it is easy to imagine the absence of either of
                              the two components of the definition: historical reality and
                              discursive reality. In the absence of historical reality we would be
                              dealing with the categories of general poetics that are called –
                              depending upon textual level – modes, registers, styles, or even
                              forms, manners, and so on. The ‘noble style’ or ‘first person
                              narration’ are indeed discursive realities; but they cannot be pinned
                              down to a single moment in time: they are always possible. By the same
                              token, in the absence of discursive reality, we would be dealing with
                              notions that belong to literary history in the broad sense, such as
                              trend, school, movement, or, in another sense of the word,
                              ‘style’.

                           only have been based on friendships or manifests (<span class="w3-tooltip w3-border-bottom w3-border-blue-grey">Todorov 2014, 202<span class="w3-text w3-tag w3-round w3-blue-grey w3-left-align w3-padding w3-large" style="position:absolute;left:0;bottom:25px">Todorov, Tzvetan. 2014. “The Origin of Genres.” In

                           there is no discursive reality or textual coherence behind works that are
                           associated with a literary current? I am in favor of the position that this
                           should not be ruled out in advance per definition but that it should be
                           tested empirically, just as the textual coherence of conventional genres in
                           the narrower sense should be examined. Digital genre stylistics provide good
                           opportunities to do so. If there are explicit manifests and poetic writings
                           that define literary schools and movements as frames of expectation for the
                           creation and reception of literary works, this can be taken as proof of
                           their relevance as historical, literary institutions. By locating literary
                           movements on the level of conventional genres, nothing is said in advance
                           about their relationship to text types and their significance as textual
                           genres. However, for Todorov, like for Fricke, purely conventional genres
                           are no genres, or at least they should not be called “genres”: “Genres are
                           the meeting place between general poetics [concerned with the theoretical
                           definition of text types] and event-based literary history [concerned with
                           the historical study of the expression of literary conventions]” (<span class="w3-tooltip w3-border-bottom w3-border-blue-grey">Todorov 2014, 201<span class="w3-text w3-tag w3-round w3-blue-grey w3-left-align w3-padding w3-large" style="position:absolute;left:0;bottom:25px">Todorov, Tzvetan. 2014. “The Origin of Genres.” In

                           movements are not directly included either. Even so, Schaeffer discusses
                           their status in the explanations accompanying his core model of discursive
                           levels to which generic terms point. He explains that there are generic
                           terms that cannot be ascribed to the five levels of the verbal act that he
                           defines, for example, terms that refer to the context, place, and time of
                           the speech act. Schaeffer explains that he does not directly include them in
                           his model but that numerous generic terms exist that refer to these aspects,
                           for example, the “baroque sonnet” or the “Greek epic” (<span class="w3-tooltip w3-border-bottom w3-border-blue-grey">Schaeffer 1983, 117–118<span class="w3-text w3-tag w3-round w3-blue-grey w3-left-align w3-padding w3-large" style="position:absolute;left:0;bottom:25px">Schaeffer, Jean-Marie. 1983. <em>Qu’est-ce qu’un

                           Schaeffer, such genre names reinforce how important the historical context
                           is for the determination of genres. Together with the multiple dimensions of
                           the verbal act that are addressed by generic terms, they show that genres
                           cannot be reduced to texts as entire, whole objects (<span class="w3-tooltip w3-border-bottom w3-border-blue-grey">Schaeffer 1983, 119<span class="w3-text w3-tag w3-round w3-blue-grey w3-left-align w3-padding w3-large" style="position:absolute;left:0;bottom:25px">Schaeffer, Jean-Marie. 1983. <em>Qu’est-ce qu’un

                           this thesis, it was noted that also many generic terms that are associated

                           relation to genres. In his book on kinds of literature, he mentions them in
                           a section called “Other types”, which is part of the chapter devoted to the
                           definition of modes and subgenres: “The system of generic categories is
                           complicated by the existence of several other quasi-generic groupings. These
                           include [...] the collective productions of ‘schools’ or movements
                           (Metaphysical; Romantic; Georgian). They must be mentioned only to be
                           dismissed” (<span class="w3-tooltip w3-border-bottom w3-border-blue-grey">Fowler 1982,

                           that the features that literary works associated with schools or movements
                           have may be “extensive and coherent enough to suggest genre” but that “they
                           exhibit them independently of the historical kinds” (<span class="w3-tooltip w3-border-bottom w3-border-blue-grey">Fowler 1982, 128<span class="w3-text w3-tag w3-round w3-blue-grey w3-left-align w3-padding w3-large" style="position:absolute;left:0;bottom:25px">Fowler, Alastair. 1982. <em>Kinds of Literature.

                           that the common features that different works belonging to a particular
                           movement share crisscross the boundaries of the genres that he calls the
                           historical kinds. As an example, he mentions the Metaphysical poets who
                           wrote in different poetic genres. Fowler states that these poems could be
                           more similar to each other than works of the same poetic genre that belonged
                           to various schools, for instance, different love elegies (<span class="w3-tooltip w3-border-bottom w3-border-blue-grey">Fowler 1982, 128<span class="w3-text w3-tag w3-round w3-blue-grey w3-left-align w3-padding w3-large" style="position:absolute;left:0;bottom:25px">Fowler, Alastair. 1982. <em>Kinds of Literature.

                           however, only a problem if genre is not analyzed on different discursive
                           levels and varying levels of generality and if it is assumed that there are
                           no overlapping associations of literary works with different kinds of
                           genres. If the love elegy is conceived as being primarily thematically
                           defined (as involving the lament for a tragic love) and a metaphysic poem
                           primarily formally – on the level of representation (as including innovative
                           use of metaphors and allegories), then these two main characteristics do not
                           exclude each other. The metaphysic poem and the love elegy can be understood
                           as two different conventional genres overlapping with different text types.
                           If Fowler says that metaphysical poems are more similar to each other than
                           love elegies of different schools, this could even mean that the
                           conventional genre “metaphysical poem” is textually more coherent than the
                           conventional genre “love elegy”. Fowler’s argument is, therefore, no
                           obstacle to also considering kinds that are conditioned by literary
                           movements as genres.</p>

                           necessary. First, she confirms that the term “novela naturalista” indeed
                           served as a generic name in the nineteenth century: 
                           <blockquote>

                           historical and systematic category. According to Schlickers, there is no
                           clear generic model for the naturalistic novel when compared, for example,
                           to the picaresque novel, for which several constant and variable textual
                           characteristics are known: “La novela naturalista, por el contrario, parece
                           constituir más bien una corriente o un movimiento literario” (<span class="w3-tooltip w3-border-bottom w3-border-blue-grey">Schlickers 2003, 16<span class="w3-text w3-tag w3-round w3-blue-grey w3-left-align w3-padding w3-large" style="position:absolute;left:0;bottom:25px">Schlickers, Sabine. 2003. <em>El lado oscuro de la

                                 Madrid, Frankfurt: Iberoamericana/Vervuert.</span></span>).
                           However, Schlickers says that all of the terms “current”, “movement”,
                           “genre”, and “poetic school” are debatable and have similar extensions,
                           although different intensions. She is in favor of modeling the naturalistic
                           novel as a subgenre because the works that are associated with this
                           convention repeatedly reference the same prototypical works of the French
                           naturalistic tradition. This shows that there was an awareness of the genre
                           and that the works in question constitute a series of naturalistic novels.
                           Schlickers states that conceptualizing the naturalistic novel as a subgenre
                           allows one to analyze its distinctive features, which guarantee the
                           coherence of the texts associated with Naturalism. At the same time,
                           analyzing the naturalistic novel as a subgenre can serve as a constructive
                           and heuristic means by which imprecise and contradictory textual features
                           and purely poetological particularities can be considered (<span class="w3-tooltip w3-border-bottom w3-border-blue-grey">Schlickers 2003, 17<span class="w3-text w3-tag w3-round w3-blue-grey w3-left-align w3-padding w3-large" style="position:absolute;left:0;bottom:25px">Schlickers, Sabine. 2003. <em>El lado oscuro de la

                           Here she assumes that there is a textual genre “novela naturalista”, but
                           that it is not entirely congruent with the conventional genre. The case of
                           the Spanish-American naturalistic novels is only one specific historical
                           example of a convention that is usually described as part of a literary
                           school or movement, but that could also be conceived as a genre. In the
                           present study, the example of the Spanish-American naturalistic novel is
                           taken as an argument in favor of the possibility of understanding literary
                           currents as a type of subgenre. Digital genre stylistics can contribute to
                           expanding the limited knowledge about common textual characteristics of

                           genres or not leads over to the issue of theoretically separating genres
                           from other discursive entities and of the place of genres in a system or
                           hierarchy of forms – also beyond the question of the difference between text
                           types and genres. There has been much research in literary genre theory on
                           this topic, and a range of different terminological systems have been
                           proposed. They cannot all be reviewed here, so only selected systems are
                           presented shortly. It will be clarified how the different kinds of
                           theoretical, generic terms that have been proposed relate to the three terms
                           of text type, conventional genre, and textual genre defined above.
                           Furthermore, as the empirical part of this study is concerned with subgenres
                           of the novel, a point of interest is how genres and subgenres relate to each
                           other. A terminological system that is prominent in the German-speaking
                           context is the one proposed by Hempfer.<sup id="ftn64" class="w3-btn w3-theme-l3 w3-circle" onclick="document.getElementById('ftn64-modal').style.display='block'">64</sup> On the one hand, he proposes to use the
                           word “genre” (in German, “Gattung”) as a meta-theoretical term which may
                           include all other terms used to designate kinds of texts (<span class="w3-tooltip w3-border-bottom w3-border-blue-grey">Hempfer 1973, 16–18<span class="w3-text w3-tag w3-round w3-blue-grey w3-left-align w3-padding w3-large" style="position:absolute;left:0;bottom:25px">Hempfer, Klaus W. 1973. <em>Gattungstheorie.

                           example “meta-genre”, “subgenre”, “form”, “kind”, “mode”, “species”,
                           “variety”, “text type”, or “text class”. This general, meta- or
                           pre-theoretical use of the term “Gattung” is what also Fricke (<span class="w3-tooltip w3-border-bottom w3-border-blue-grey">1981, 133<span class="w3-text w3-tag w3-round w3-blue-grey w3-left-align w3-padding w3-large" style="position:absolute;left:0;bottom:25px">Fricke, Harald. 1981. <em>Norm und Abweichung. Eine
                                    Philosophie der Literatur.</em> München: Beck.</span></span>) suggests. When no
                           further theoretical distinctions are made, the term “genre” is used in this
                           general sense here, as well. On a second level below the most general
                           meta-term, Hempfer defines several theoretical terms for specific kinds of
                           text groupings. The main components of his terminological system are
                           “Schreibweise” (“diction”), “Typ” (“type”), “Gattung” (“genre”), and
                           “Untergattung” (“subgenre”). “Dictions” are defined as ahistorical constants
                           (e.g., “the narrative”, “the dramatic”, “the satiric”); “types” as
                           trans-temporal forms of dictions, that is, as the theoretically possible set
                           of types derived from them; “genres” as historical and concrete realizations
                           of the general dictions (e.g., “novel”, “epopee”, “verse satire”); and
                           “subgenres” as subtypes of single genres (e.g., “picaresque novel”,
                           “pathetic verse satire”). According to Hempfer, types and genres can both be
                           derived from dictions via transformations, which means that his system
                           builds on a dynamical and structural concept and not a hierarchical one.
                           Genres and subgenres do not need to be based only on one diction but can be
                           derived from several ones (e.g., a “comic epic”). In addition, Hempfer uses
                           the term “Sammelbegriff” (“collective term”) for terms that designate
                           classes in a logical sense. Individual texts can be assigned to such classes
                           on the basis of any characteristic (e.g., “poetry” as texts in verse form)
                           (<span class="w3-tooltip w3-border-bottom w3-border-blue-grey">Hempfer 1973, 27–28<span class="w3-text w3-tag w3-round w3-blue-grey w3-left-align w3-padding w3-large" style="position:absolute;left:0;bottom:25px">Hempfer, Klaus W. 1973. <em>Gattungstheorie.
                                    Information und Synthese.</em> München: Fink.</span></span>).
                           Comparing Hempfer’s system to the three terms of text type, conventional
                           genre, and textual genre used here, the following observations can be made.
                           The term that is closest to the text type is Hempfer’s
                           <em>Sammelbegriff</em> because it designates a purely logical
                           grouping without necessary relationships to a certain theory of genre or a
                           genre convention. However, the <em>Sammelbegriff</em> is different in
                           that it presupposes logical classes, which is not done for the text type
                           here. The categorical status of text types and textual genres has to be
                           clarified further, which is done in <a href="ch2.html#ch2.1.4">chapter 2.1.4</a>&nbsp;below. Not only common but also similar features of
                           texts can be constitutive for text types. Hempfer’s <em>Gattung</em>
                           corresponds roughly to the textual genre in that it designates groups of
                           texts that share textual features for which there is historical evidence and
                           which were relevant as communicative norms. A slight difference is that the
                           textual features of Hempfer’s <em>Gattungen</em> are derived from the
                           features of underlying ahistorical constants, whereas the aspect of the
                           origin and motivation of the textual characteristics is not covered by the
                           terminological distinction proposed here. Hempfer’s
                           <em>Untergattungen</em> can be considered subtypes of textual genres.
                           As far as I can see, there is no equivalence to the purely conventional
                           genre in Hempfer’s system of terms. Hempfer’s <em>Schreibweisen</em> and
                           <em>Typen</em> as purely theoretical terms are not covered here,
                           which shows that the three proposed terms of text type, conventional genre,
                           and textual genre focus on the mediation of text-immanent generic features
                           and text-external communicational as well as purely conventional aspects of
                           genres on an empirical level. It is a further task to build new theories
                           based on textual genres that are found in this process of mediation or to
                           clarify their relationship to existing literary theories of genre.</p>
                        
                        <p id="p87"><span class="paracount w3-blue-grey w3-margin-right"><a href="#p87">87</a></span>Another system of terms is used by Fowler, who distinguishes
                           between “kinds”, which are the historical genres (e.g., sonnet, parable),
                           “modes”, which are selections or abstractions from kinds (e.g., comic,
                           aphoristic), “subgenres”, which are subtypes of kinds (e.g., sea eclogue,
                           historical novel), and “constructional types”, which are purely formal
                           patterns (e.g., ring composition, sequence). To distinguish between the
                           different sorts of generic categories, Fowler uses the idea of a “generic
                           repertoire”, which means all possible levels on which features that are
                           characteristic of a genre can be chosen. A basic distinction is made between
                           “formal” and “substantive” features. Formal features include structural
                           characteristics and, for example, verse metres. Substantive features are,
                           for instance, related to themes, purpose, and intended audience. The
                           <em>kinds</em> usually combine both types of features, whereas the
                           <em>constructional types</em> are only based on formal features.
                           <em>Modes</em> are more or less unstructured. They have no or only a
                           few formal features but invoke kinds through samples of their substantive
                           features. The <em>subgenres</em> are defined as having the same formal
                           features as their corresponding kind, plus additional characteristics
                           related to the content of the texts (<span class="w3-tooltip w3-border-bottom w3-border-blue-grey">Fowler 1982, 55–56<span class="w3-text w3-tag w3-round w3-blue-grey w3-left-align w3-padding w3-large" style="position:absolute;left:0;bottom:25px">Fowler, Alastair. 1982. <em>Kinds of Literature.

                           relationship of Fowler’s terms to text types, conventional genres, and
                           textual genres, the following observations can be made: <em>kinds</em>
                           can be understood as corresponding more or less to the textual genres and
                           subgenres to subtypes of textual genres. What Fowler emphasizes repeatedly
                           is the historical variability of the kinds’ features.<sup id="ftn65" class="w3-btn w3-theme-l3 w3-circle" onclick="document.getElementById('ftn65-modal').style.display='block'">65</sup> This raises the question of whether one kind
                           should be conceived as one textual genre allowing for internal variation or
                           eventually several textual genres based on more compact text types. This
                           question will be addressed in the next <a href="ch2.html#ch2.1.4">chapter 2.1.4</a>&nbsp;on categorization. However, Fowler
                           also states that despite all variation and historical change, kinds are not
                           indeterminate. Preliminarily, he defines them as follows: “a kind is a type
                           of literary work of a definite size, marked by a complex of substantive and
                           formal features that always include a distinctive (though not usually
                           unique) external structure” (<span class="w3-tooltip w3-border-bottom w3-border-blue-grey">Fowler 1982, 74<span class="w3-text w3-tag w3-round w3-blue-grey w3-left-align w3-padding w3-large" style="position:absolute;left:0;bottom:25px">Fowler, Alastair. 1982. <em>Kinds of Literature.

                                 Press.</span></span>). As Hempfer’s <em>Schreibweisen</em>, also
                           Fowler’s <em>modes</em> are not directly covered by the concepts of text
                           type, conventional genre, and textual genre. The latter refer to literary
                           texts as structural units, whereas the former are abstracted and
                           disconnected from external structures: “Modes have always an incomplete
                           repertoire, a selection only of the corresponding kind’s features, and one
                           from which overall external structure is absent” (<span class="w3-tooltip w3-border-bottom w3-border-blue-grey">Fowler 1982, 107<span class="w3-text w3-tag w3-round w3-blue-grey w3-left-align w3-padding w3-large" style="position:absolute;left:0;bottom:25px">Fowler, Alastair. 1982. <em>Kinds of Literature.

                        <p id="p88"><span class="paracount w3-blue-grey w3-margin-right"><a href="#p88">88</a></span>In this study, no principle difference is made between genres
                           and subgenres. Like genres, also subgenres can be conventional genres, and
                           they can overlap with text types to form textual genres. One difference
                           between both is that the genres usually have a more precise formal
                           delimitation than different subtypes of the same genre. The latter tend to
                           be based on differences in subject matter or style so that different textual
                           characteristics and features become relevant in each case. In addition,
                           subgenres can be very inconsistent because they are formally less fixed than
                           genres. As Fowler remarks, “To determine the features of a subgenre is to
                           trace a diachronic process of imitation, variation, innovation—in fact, to
                           verge on source study. At the level of subgenre, innovation is life” (<span class="w3-tooltip w3-border-bottom w3-border-blue-grey">Fowler 1982, 114<span class="w3-text w3-tag w3-round w3-blue-grey w3-left-align w3-padding w3-large" style="position:absolute;left:0;bottom:25px">Fowler, Alastair. 1982. <em>Kinds of Literature.

                           therefore be more challenging to find the correspondences between
                           conventional subgenres and text types than between conventional genres and
                           text types, and hence be more challenging to determine the textual subgenres
                           than textual genres. However, the degree of innovation that subgenres
                           undergo depends on the type of subgenre that is investigated and on factors
                           such as canonicity and perceived literariness of the works. Especially in
                           popular literature, it is to be expected that there are works that follow
                           quite schematic patterns of subgenres.</p>
                        
                        <p id="p89"><span class="paracount w3-blue-grey w3-margin-right"><a href="#p89">89</a></span>Even if the levels of genre and subgenre are not strictly
                           separated here, it makes sense to consider them in the construction of the
                           corpus to be analyzed to compare genres on a similar level of specificity.
                           If subgenres are the point of interest, it makes sense to build a corpus of
                           instances of the corresponding genre and to include works in it that are
                           associated with different types of subgenres. Then the selection criteria
                           for the corpus as a whole can be based on the formal characteristics that
                           define the genre. That way, determining textual subgenres does not need to
                           be restricted by defining text types beforehand. Different subgenres of the
                           contextualizing major genre can then be contrasted with each other. The
                           relationship of subordination between genres and subgenres is a means of
                           combining a deductive with an inductive procedure in constructing a corpus.
                           Other strategies are conceivable, for example, to combine historical labels
                           as signals for conventional genres with preliminary (sub)genre definitions
                           as proxies to textual genres to build a corpus from which to start the

                           entity is the one that participates in genre? Raible sees an affinity
                           between genres and specific degrees of complexity. He observes that, in
                           general, text is a relative and dynamic notion. A novel such as “Eugenie
                           Grandet” by Balzac is a text, but the series of novels that it belongs to,
                           the “Comédie humaine”, or only a subpart of the novel such as a single
                           chapter, are also texts. Usually, genre is bound to the level of the single,
                           whole novel (<span class="w3-tooltip w3-border-bottom w3-border-blue-grey">Raible 1980,

                                 320–349.</span></span>). Instances of this kind of textual entity are the ones that
                           are collected in a corpus, that are associated with one or several genres,
                           and that are analyzed as to their textual coherence and compliance with
                           generic conventions. However, a novel like “Eugenie Grandet” is a literary
                           work, and as such, it can be realized as text in different forms and
                           contexts. Is genre linked to the literary work as a whole or a specific
                           realization of it in text form? How stable is the association between the
                           literary work or text and the genre? In principle, it is assumed that the
                           generic identity of a text is identical to the generic identity of the work
                           that the text represents. This means that an English translation of “Eugenie
                           Grandet” would generally be considered as participating in the same genre as
                           the original French text. Different editions of a work in the same language
                           but published in different years or even centuries would also commonly be
                           associated with the same genre. If there is a new work, also the genre may
                           be different. “Eugenie Grandet” as a drama or movie would be a new work and
                           have a different genre. If one looks more closely, this question is,
                           however, not so easy to resolve. First, one can debate whether a new version
                           of a text is another realization of the same work or another work.<sup id="ftn67" class="w3-btn w3-theme-l3 w3-circle" onclick="document.getElementById('ftn67-modal').style.display='block'">67</sup> Second, as genres are
                           conventions that can be described as literary institutions and as horizons
                           of expectation for authors, publishers, readers, critics, etc., which are
                           anchored in specific historical settings, the generic identity of a work can
                           be influenced by the context in which it is realized. This is illustrated
                           clearly by Schaeffer, who discusses the example of the story “Pierre Menard,
                           autor del Quijote”, which was published in 1939 by Jorge Luis Borges. The
                           story centers on the idea that the fictional author Pierre Menard publishes
                           parts of the work “Don Quijote” as his own creation in the twentieth
                           century, although formally, they correspond exactly to the text authored by
                           Cervantes and published in the early seventeenth century. As Schaeffer
                           illustrates, the syntactically identical text would have different generic
                           identities because in the twentieth century, it would be considered a
                           historical novel with an archaic style, whereas in the seventeenth century,
                           it was primarily received as a parody on romances of chivalry (<span class="w3-tooltip w3-border-bottom w3-border-blue-grey">Schaeffer 1983, 131–134<span class="w3-text w3-tag w3-round w3-blue-grey w3-left-align w3-padding w3-large" style="position:absolute;left:0;bottom:25px">Schaeffer, Jean-Marie. 1983. <em>Qu’est-ce qu’un

                           In this case, also the author is different, and one could therefore speak of
                           two different works when comparing the original “Don Quijote” to the
                           imagined twentieth-century recreation of it. Nevertheless, the example makes
                           clear that the generic identity of a literary work may depend on its
                           realization as a document in a specific context.</p>
                        
                        <p id="p91"><span class="paracount w3-blue-grey w3-margin-right"><a href="#p91">91</a></span>In the digital bibliography of nineteenth-century
                           Spanish-American novels created for this study, there are examples of works
                           that have been associated with different subgenres of the novel in different
                           editions, marked by different subtitles. For instance, the novel “Tomochic”
                           by the Mexican writer Heriberto Frías was first published in 1894 with the
                           subtitles “Episodios de la Campaña de Chihuahua. 1892. Relación escrita por
                           un testigo presencial”. In 1899, it was republished without any subtitle,
                           and in 1906, the subtitle was changed to “Novela histórica mexicana”. This
                           shows how the novel was initially presented as a testimony and a
                           contemporary documentary novel, and only twelve years later, it was
                           considered a historical novel. Modern critics have interpreted it as a
                           historical, political, social, realist, and naturalistic novel.<sup id="ftn68" class="w3-btn w3-theme-l3 w3-circle" onclick="document.getElementById('ftn68-modal').style.display='block'">68</sup> Such
                           generic variability of individual literary works can be clarified when
                           considering it in relation to concepts of text type, conventional genre, and
                           textual genre. Concerning its text-immanent characteristics, and more
                           specifically, its stylistic features, the work does not change over time
                           because these do not depend on the communicative and historical context in
                           which it is embedded through its various realizations. For this to be true,
                           the simplifying assumption is made that the different published editions do
                           not involve considerable textual adaptations of the work. This means that
                           the different text types that the work can belong to do not change. They
                           depend on the textual level and the kind of textual features that are
                           selected for the analysis (for example, most frequent words or topics). What
                           may have changed in a different historical context is the conventional
                           genre, that is, the concept of the genre that was effective at the time, as
                           well as the specific communicative context in which the work is to be seen,
                           which involves the expectations of publishers and readers. It may then be
                           the case that the work did not fit the conventional criteria for a
                           historical novel when it was first published but that it did with the 1906
                           edition. The concept of the historical novel may have changed by that time.
                           Furthermore, the novel only falls into the definitory pattern of the
                           historical novel once there is a greater distance between its creation and
                           publication year, which means that the perspective on it has changed. If the
                           generic convention that the literary work is associated with is a different
                           one, also the textual genre becomes another one because it is derived from a
                           different intersection of genre label and text type.</p>
                        
                        <p id="p92"><span class="paracount w3-blue-grey w3-margin-right"><a href="#p92">92</a></span>Again, this makes clear that digital stylistics must take
                           conventional genres into account if it aims to produce text analysis results
                           that are historically adequate. In addition, when a corpus is created for
                           digital stylistic analysis, the question of generic identity of the
                           individual texts has to be tackled. For the corpus of nineteenth-century
                           Spanish-American novels created here, it was decided to attribute all
                           subgenre assignments directly to the work level. As laid out in more detail
                           in the chapter on creating the bibliography and corpus, it was encoded if
                           the assignments are contemporary or literary-historical. The boundary
                           between both was drawn based on two criteria: first, the temporal limits of
                           the corpus, and second, the origin of the genre label as endogenous and
                           textual or exogenous and meta-textual. As the corpus covers works that were
                           first published between 1830 and 1910, subgenre assignments that were made
                           after 1910 are considered literary-historical, and the ones before that year
                           as contemporary. In addition, the labels that are derived from paratextual
                           signals are differentiated from the ones that external actors conferred. So
                           in this concrete case, for the purpose of subgenre assignment, a
                           simplification was made by defining the period that is covered by the corpus
                           as broadly homogeneous regarding the historical genre conventions. This was
                           done because the change over time of individual subgenres is not the primary
                           concern of the analysis conducted here. If it was, it would have been more
                           important to consider the changing conventional generic identities.</p>
                        
                        <p id="p93"><span class="paracount w3-blue-grey w3-margin-right"><a href="#p93">93</a></span>At the beginning of this chapter, several core issues regarding
                           the relationship between the theory and the history of genres were raised.
                           The last one, referring to the origin and evolution of genres, has yet to be
                           discussed. Theories for genre change are an extensive topic of their own,
                           and literary genre theorists have made several different propositions in
                           this regard. For example, Todorov presents a theory about the origin of
                           genres: “Where do genres come from? Quite simply from other genres. A new
                           genre is always the transformation of an earlier one, or of several: by
                           inversion, by displacement, by combination” (<span class="w3-tooltip w3-border-bottom w3-border-blue-grey">Todorov 2014, 197<span class="w3-text w3-tag w3-round w3-blue-grey w3-left-align w3-padding w3-large" style="position:absolute;left:0;bottom:25px">Todorov, Tzvetan. 2014. “The Origin of Genres.” In

                                 Routledge.</span></span>). He thus sees the generic
                           system as one that is in constant transformation, and he approaches the
                           question of the formation of genres not through historical analysis but
                           through systematic considerations. Different types of genres are compared to
                           other kinds of speech acts to which they are related. For example, the
                           prayer as a genre is related to praying as a speech act, the novel to
                           telling, and the sonnet to “sonneting”, which does not exist as an
                           institutionalized speech act. Todorov concludes that different kinds of
                           developments are involved, from general simple speech acts to more complex
                           literary genres, but that in general, genres derive from “normal” language:
                           “that makes it possible to see that there is not an abyss between literature
                           and what is not literature, that the literary genres originate, quite
                           simply, in human discourse” (<span class="w3-tooltip w3-border-bottom w3-border-blue-grey">Todorov 2014, 208<span class="w3-text w3-tag w3-round w3-blue-grey w3-left-align w3-padding w3-large" style="position:absolute;left:0;bottom:25px">Todorov, Tzvetan. 2014. “The Origin of Genres.” In

                           theories, generic change does not need an independent explanation because it
                           is a central part of the genre concepts. For example, of the three generic
                           logics Schaeffer proposes, three are based on the principle of modulation,
                           which entails that each text that participates in a genre modifies the genre
                           characteristics (<span class="w3-tooltip w3-border-bottom w3-border-blue-grey">Schaeffer

                           extent to which one or several texts alter the genre concept. In Jauß’s
                           theory, the history of genres is explained with the variability of the
                           readers’ (and authors’) horizons of expectations as a “temporal process of
                           the continual founding and altering” (<span class="w3-tooltip w3-border-bottom w3-border-blue-grey">Jauß 2014, 132<span class="w3-text w3-tag w3-round w3-blue-grey w3-left-align w3-padding w3-large" style="position:absolute;left:0;bottom:25px">Jauß, Hans Robert. 2014. “Theory of Genres and Medieval

                           literary-social institutions also involves processes of permanent reductions

                           genre theorists have developed for the origins and changes of genres and
                           generic systems. Similar to Schaeffer, Jauß, and Voßkamp, Fowler assumes
                           that processes of change are at work constantly, but in his view, these
                           processes are inherently literary and not of a general linguistic or
                           historical nature. Taking into account many literary-historical examples,
                           Fowler describes the main types of transformation processes. Among these,

                           context of text types, conventional genres, and textual genres? In general,
                           also change can be described on these three levels: there can be textual
                           change leading to transformed and new text types, change in conventional
                           genres if there is, for example, a poetic discussion resulting in new
                           elements that are considered necessary for a specific genre, or if texts are
                           associated with new conventions through the use of genre signals or labels.
                           The transformation of the textual genres is then a result of the shifts that
                           are at work on the other two levels: if either the text type or the
                           conventional genre or both at the same time change, then also the textual
                           genre becomes different. A more difficult question is where the boundary
                           between one text type and another, one conventional genre and a different
                           one, and hence also between one textual genre and a new one lies. If genre
                           transformations are assumed to be constantly at work, how can the unity of a
                           text type, a conventional genre, or a textual genre be defined at all? This
                           question is crucial not only for the historical change of genres but also
                           for their description from a synchronic perspective. The boundaries between
                           different text types, various conventional genres, and textual genres are
                           not necessarily clear-cut. The overlap of text types and conventional genres
                           can also take several forms. These problems are discussed in chapter <a href="ch2.html#ch2.1.4">2.1.4</a>, on categorization.</p>

                           theory, can cover whole periods or several periods of literature, digital
                           genre stylistics is enabled to address genre analysis over time. Different
                           approaches to this problem are possible and have been pursued. Although
                           generic change cannot be comprehensively considered in this study, some
                           general remarks on the importance of corpus design in this regard are made.
                           Obviously, a central aspect to capture change over time is the collection of
                           metadata about the creation or publication dates of the literary works that
                           are part of the corpus that is analyzed. Furthermore, decisions have to be
                           made about the status of different editions of the same works. Questions
                           are, for example, if only first historical editions are considered or if
                           modern editions are used, and also if only one edition per work is analyzed
                           or if different versions of works are compared. In most cases in which
                           transformations of genres over time have been analyzed in digital genre
                           stylistics so far, the reference to temporal metadata is the primary
                           strategy to capture change. For example, a corpus can be subdivided into an
                           earlier and a later period, and the texts contained in both partitions can
                           be compared to find the differences between early and late variants of the
                           genres that are covered by the text collection. Such differentiation can
                           also be made in a more granular way, analyzing, for example, differences by
                           decade or by year. Jockers, for example, analyzes the stylistic change of
                           novels in English by decade (<span class="w3-tooltip w3-border-bottom w3-border-blue-grey">Jockers 2013, 82–89<span class="w3-text w3-tag w3-round w3-blue-grey w3-left-align w3-padding w3-large" style="position:absolute;left:0;bottom:25px">Jockers, Matthew L. 2013. <em>Macroanalysis.

                           analyze the novels over time is the same for all points in time or periods.
                           What is measured is how the feature distributions change in relation to the
                           temporal metadata. One could propose different historical stages of text
                           types if the values and constellations of the textual features vary
                           considerably between one and another period. Another way to model textual
                           change is to create different feature sets for different points in time or
                           features that develop over time. In that case, a challenge is to clarify how
                           the different feature sets or features are related to each other so that it
                           is possible to speak about a change. For example, there are dynamic topic
                           models in which the composition of the topics evolves temporally (<span class="w3-tooltip w3-border-bottom w3-border-blue-grey">Blei and Lafferty

                           the level of the text types. This can be linked to developments of
                           conventional genres if, for instance, metadata about different genre labels
                           that the texts had at different points in time is integrated into the
                           analyses, as Underwood did in his account of Gothic novels (<span class="w3-tooltip w3-border-bottom w3-border-blue-grey">Underwood 2016<span class="w3-text w3-tag w3-round w3-blue-grey w3-left-align w3-padding w3-large" style="position:absolute;left:0;bottom:25px">Underwood, Ted. 2016. “The Life Cycles of Genres.”

                           even if the genre labels are constant, changes in the text types produce
                           different intersections with conventional genres and hence altered textual
                           genres.</p>
                        
                        <p id="p96"><span class="paracount w3-blue-grey w3-margin-right"><a href="#p96">96</a></span>Several issues that are related to the question of the
                           systematic or historical nature of literary genres were discussed in this
                           subchapter. Different literary genre theories emphasize the dependence of
                           genres from the historical context to different degrees. Several
                           terminological systems have been developed to distinguish between
                           historically constant and more variable generic notions, between
                           linguistically and text-founded types as well as conventional groupings of
                           texts. Digital genre stylistics has been described here as a field of
                           research in which there is a strong focus on the analysis of text types
                           because groups of literary works are formed and analyzed based on stylistic
                           features that are derived from the linguistic surface of the texts. Then
                           again, in its applied form, digital literary stylistics is mainly concerned
                           with empirical analyses of historical text corpora, so that questions of the
                           historicity of the texts inevitably have to be addressed. Such questions
                           are, for example, which literary period to cover with the corpus, how the
                           literary works in the corpus are dated, which types of editions to use, and
                           from which perspective and based on which sources the generic identity of
                           the works is determined. Usually, it is especially the latter aspect of
                           deciding on the type of genre labels that links digital genre stylistic
                           analyses to modern or historical genre conventions. Literary works in very
                           large digital corpora can normally not be labeled according to purely
                           theoretical criteria that have been developed based on close reading of
                           texts and that require close reading for their application. Instead, the
                           genre labeling of works in large text collections usually needs to be based
                           on categorizations that others have made for part of the texts (authors,
                           editors, readers, critics, librarians, scholars, etc.), so that sets of
                           genre labels are the result of collective decisions influenced by the
                           respective generic conventions and theories that apply.</p>
                        
                        <p id="p97"><span class="paracount w3-blue-grey w3-margin-right"><a href="#p97">97</a></span>Besides selecting genre labels, selecting works for the corpus
                           also means that a connection to contemporary or historical expectations
                           towards genres is established. If, for example, a corpus of novels is
                           assembled to analyze subtypes of novels, the genre discourse is already
                           involved in the outer delimitation of the corpus, even if the subtypes of
                           the novel are defined by relying exclusively on textual surface features.
                           That is, even a text-centered analysis of literary types addresses questions
                           of genre as soon as this notion is part of the definition of the corpus.
                           Therefore, it is argued that both literary text types as systematic
                           groupings of texts based on textual features and conventional literary
                           genres as historically bound literary institutions are important for digital
                           genre stylistic analyses. However, the potential of digital genre stylistics
                           to enhance the knowledge about the literary history of genres can best be
                           developed if literary text types and conventional literary genres are
                           terminologically separated and defined independently of each other in the
                           first place. That way, insights into textual genres are not limited from the
                           outset by requirements of completeness, integrity, or congruence on either
                           of the other two levels. The initial separation of levels on which genres
                           (in the general sense) are analyzed is the more important as stylistic
                           textual features can be very different from the literary features that have
                           been formulated as defining genres either in historical conventions or
                           literary theories, or both. Defining textual literary genres as convergences
                           or intersections of text types and conventional genres allows for finding
                           new correspondences between both perspectives on the genres.</p>

                           dimension, the individual-cognitive dimension, and the functional dimension)

                           aspects can also be connected to both of them, even if they are not the
                           primary focus of digital genre stylistics. Compared to the integration of
                           the different analysis levels in the “compact definition” of genre, the
                           convergence of text types and conventional genres in textual genres
                           described here is more concrete because it refers to intersections of text
                           groups. The terminological differentiation between literary text types,
                           conventional, and textual genres relates directly to the possibilities and
                           characteristics of digital quantitative approaches. They need their own
                           genre theoretical foundation, not because they should be isolated from other
                           directions of genre research, but to have adequate terms that allow for
                           communicating and clarifying what genre stylistics can contribute to genre

                           onwards, attempts were made to systematize the field of literary texts by
                           grouping them on the basis of formal, functional, and content-related
                           similarities, with the goal to provide “as exact a classification of
                           concrete texts into clearly disjunct classes as possible” (<span class="w3-tooltip w3-border-bottom w3-border-blue-grey">Hempfer 2014, 405<span class="w3-text w3-tag w3-round w3-blue-grey w3-left-align w3-padding w3-large" style="position:absolute;left:0;bottom:25px">Hempfer, Klaus W. 2014. “Some Aspects of a Theory of

                           scholars and is useful for several reasons. For instance, it helps to build
                           corpora of literary texts that cover a delimited area. In addition,
                           classificatory terms can be used to find out to which genre a work belongs
                           at all. Furthermore, knowledge about necessary features of genres is helpful
                           when texts associated with the genres are interpreted. Classification also
                           provides a way to organize the “embroiled world of literature” (<span class="w3-tooltip w3-border-bottom w3-border-blue-grey">Strube 1993, 41<span class="w3-text w3-tag w3-round w3-blue-grey w3-left-align w3-padding w3-large" style="position:absolute;left:0;bottom:25px">Strube, Werner. 1993. <em>Analytische Philosophie der

                           defining classes that require the presence of a fixed set of features for
                           its members and that fit into a system of non-overlapping categories – is
                           applied to literary genres, there are also limits to its usefulness. Bonheim
                           describes them when pondering the limits of his cladistic method of
                           classifying genres: 
                           <blockquote>
                              There are five distinct grounds why cladograms of genres are
                              fraught with such uncertainties. One has been mentioned: our
                              definitions are not sufficiently encyclopedic. A second one is that
                              genres are alive and change from age to age. A third is that genres in
                              France are different from genres in England or Germany; for it is a
                              common observation that genre terms are frequently untranslatable, and
                              we feel forced to speak of a <em>conte</em> or a
                              <em>Bildungsroman</em> in English and of the
                              <em>villanelle</em> and the <em>short story</em> in German.
                              So genres and genre terms are marked on grounds of national origin as
                              well as history. The fourth reason is that genre terms are rarely
                              terms in the scientific sense, but semi-terms, made grubby by repeated
                              use and misuse. The fifth reason is that every new critical school,
                              like every new drive into the bottomless pit of linguistic theories,
                              calls our attention to some qualities of texts which, as far as we are
                              aware, had not before been clearly brought into focus. That means that
                              every model of genre is an <em>open</em> set of features. No
                              cladogram can be final and valid for all time and users.

                           dependence on a cultural and linguistic context and the historical
                           variability of genres, which a classificatory approach cannot directly
                           cover. Further problems derive from models’ theory dependence and
                           selectivity, but these are independent of the categorization procedure.
                           Bonheim concludes that definitions of text kinds are, above all, heuristic
                           tools (<span class="w3-tooltip w3-border-bottom w3-border-blue-grey">Bonheim 1992, 16<span class="w3-text w3-tag w3-round w3-blue-grey w3-left-align w3-padding w3-large" style="position:absolute;left:0;bottom:25px">Bonheim, Helmut. 1992. “The Cladistic Method of

                           That classificatory definitions of genres are not able to cover synchronic

                           classificatory procedures by arguing that literary scholars do not classify
                           in the same way as linguists or other empirically working scientists: 
                           <blockquote>

                           the analyzed text classes are directly linked to the genre labels so that
                           the correspondence (or non-correspondence) of generic terms to specific
                           textual features can be checked straightforwardly. Furthermore, the success
                           or failure of the classification can be easily measured by comparing the
                           actual genre labels, that is, the labels that the texts were associated with
                           at the outset of the analysis, to the ones predicted by a classifier. If the
                           genre labels represent the conventional genres and the texts themselves are
                           the data based on which text types can be defined, then supervised
                           classification is an ideal method to test to what extent both levels
                           overlap. The more successful a classification based on selected genre labels
                           and textual features is, the more probable it is that the conventional
                           genres represented by the labels actually correspond to text types defined
                           on the grounds of the selected features. As a consequence, it is also
                           probable that they constitute textual genres. As at least one positive and
                           one negative class are needed for supervised classification, as a minimum,
                           two conventional genres and two text types are involved in such an analysis.
                           The text types are then differentiated not by the <em>kind</em> of
                           features – because the same feature set is used in the whole setting – but
                           by the characteristics of the feature <em>values</em> and how the
                           various feature values are distributed in one text type versus the other.
                           Because the classes are clearly separated from each other, it is possible to
                           inspect the feature distributions in each class to learn about its textual
                           characteristics, and it can also be analyzed which features are decisive to
                           separate one class from the other. This means that text types and textual
                           genres are defined contrastively in a classificatory setting. This
                           highlights the importance of deciding which conventional genres and which
                           literary works associated with them should be analyzed together to find the
                           corresponding text types and textual genres.</p>

                           yield very accurate results, depending on the kind of conventional genre
                           that is analyzed, the individual literary works that participate in it and
                           that are selected for the text corpus, and the textual level that is
                           examined. Then the reasons for the failure have to be investigated. Low
                           classification rates can indicate problems with the selection of features or
                           the classification parameters and methods, but they may also be due to the
                           underlying category not having the structure that is assumed. It can, for
                           example, be checked which works are repeatedly misclassified to find out
                           which part of the corpus is not compatible with the textual genres that the
                           classifier learned. Are there only a few works that do not fit? A closer
                           look at them can serve to check if they can be seen as outliers, as texts
                           participating in the conventional genre but not in the textual one because
                           they are not compatible with the text type underlying the other works of the
                           genre. What if a bigger group of texts is affected by misclassifications?
                           This might indicate that there is more than one text type that is connected
                           to the conventional genre or that no textual unity can be found for it at
                           all. In such cases, alternative categorization methods can complement the
                           <em>classic</em> classification methods to find out how the
                           conventional genre in question is structured internally on the textual
                           level. Considering the observations that have been made in literary theory
                           and history about the individual relationships between literary works and
                           “their” genres and about constant processes of modulation and
                           transformation, it is very probable that there are such cases of
                           conventional genres that cannot be neatly mapped to text types and that are
                           not coherent textual genres.</p>

                           alternatives that already have a tradition in literary genre theory. A
                           typological description of genres starts from individual literary works seen
                           as typical or especially representative of the genre in question. The
                           genre’s characteristics are then derived from the exemplary texts by
                           isolating, generalizing, or even exaggerating their properties. That way, an
                           ideal type is constructed, constituting an extreme case when compared to
                           other types (<span class="w3-tooltip w3-border-bottom w3-border-blue-grey">Strube 1993,

                           of the prototype effect, the ideal types have been called “prototypes”. The
                           prototype effect describes general perception and cognition principles
                           involved when humans categorize things. Some instances of categories are
                           recognized faster than others because they have some typical
                           characteristics. The typical features do not even need to be necessary for
                           the category. For example, a prototypical table has four legs, but tables do
                           not need to have this exact number of legs. When things are categorized,
                           they are not checked systematically for present or absent features but are
                           compared to different ideal types based on their attributes. The proximity
                           or distance to an ideal type is decisive for perceiving something as a
                           member of the category in question (<span class="w3-tooltip w3-border-bottom w3-border-blue-grey">Rosch and Mervis 1975<span class="w3-text w3-tag w3-round w3-blue-grey w3-left-align w3-padding w3-large" style="position:absolute;left:0;bottom:25px">Rosch, Eleanor, and Carolyn B.

                           resulting categories are different from logical classes. Membership is not
                           based on a set of necessary and sufficient conditions that can either be
                           fulfilled or not and is not simply a question of belonging or not belonging.
                           Prototypical categories have a core and an internal structure that runs from
                           the core to the edges of the category in a continuous way. The edges are not
                           sharp but fuzzy because membership is defined in terms of closeness to the
                           prototypical core, which also entails that there are degrees of membership.
                           As Hempfer, who sounded out the potential of prototype theory for literary
                           genre theory, summarizes: 
                           <blockquote>
                              Given that the difference between categories is constituted by the
                              respective prototypical cores, the problem of ‘boundaries’ loses its
                              poignancy because categories can indeed overlap at their edges when
                              one entity variously resembles different prototypical cores in roughly
                              equal measure. The key factor in the distinction between class
                              inclusion and prototype theory lies in the terminological shift that
                              relocates distinguishing characteristics of categories from their
                              boundaries to their <em>cores</em> and attributes an entity to a
                              category via its relationship of resemblance to the prototypical
                              core.

                           As an example, he discusses narrative versus dramatic communication.
                           Paradigmatic (that is, prototypical) forms of narration are the epics of
                           Homer or Cervantes’ “Don Quixote”, realistic novels in the nineteenth
                           century, or popular twentieth-century fiction. On the other hand, there are
                           also deviations from the prototypical norm, for example, when drama is
                           narrativized, or narrative is performatized. Nevertheless, untypical
                           instances of narrative or dramatic communication can still be recognized as
                           such as long as they have a closer relationship to their respective
                           prototypical core than to the core of the other category, which according to
                           Hempfer, is also a question of “reference” (<span class="w3-tooltip w3-border-bottom w3-border-blue-grey">Hempfer 2014, 414–415<span class="w3-text w3-tag w3-round w3-blue-grey w3-left-align w3-padding w3-large" style="position:absolute;left:0;bottom:25px">Hempfer, Klaus W. 2014. “Some Aspects of a Theory of

                           of prototype theory to literary genres (in the form of modes), both the
                           levels of the literary text type and the conventional genre are involved.
                           The implicit or explicit reference to a generic prototype must be viewed as
                           a genre signal indicating to&nbsp;which literary institution a text is assigned,
                           while the amount of narrative or performative passages in a text is located
                           on the textual level. This complicates matters because a literary work then
                           has relationships to prototypical cores on two levels: that of the generic
                           convention and that of the text type. Differentiating these levels, as is
                           done in the present study, can mean that a literary work can be closer to a
                           particular conventional prototype because the work carries the respective
                           genre label or other signals pointing to it. At the same time, on the
                           textual level, a work can be closer to a different prototype. As a result,
                           it can be interpreted as an untypical member of two textual genres. As an
                           untypical member of the textual genre (or mode) “narrative”, a narrativized
                           drama can be closer to the narrative literary text type than to the dramatic
                           one but be more distant to the conventional narrative genre than to the
                           dramatic one. Vice-versa, as an untypical member of the textual genre
                           “drama”, it is close to the core of the conventional genre but more distant
                           to the core of the corresponding text type.</p>

                           accomplished masterpiece or as the foundational text of the genre.<sup id="ftn78" class="w3-btn w3-theme-l3 w3-circle" onclick="document.getElementById('ftn78-modal').style.display='block'">78</sup> Examples of this are references to Walter
                           Scott’s “Waverley” in historical novels or to Goethe’s “Wilhelm Meisters
                           Lehrjahre” in education novels. Works that reference their prototype are
                           expected to either imitate it closely or vary it to different degrees. In
                           addition, a literary work can contain references to several different
                           prototypical works. The prototypical genre categories that are grounded on
                           hypertextual relationships are necessarily anchored in time and closely
                           related to the literary-historical context. Literary works can only
                           reference other works that existed before them, and the writers must be

                           instances of texts are needed to constitute a genre in this sense: the

                           analysis of nineteenth-century Spanish-American novels. The novels are
                           associated with the subgenres of sentimental, historical,
                           <em>costumbrista-</em>, <em>gaucho</em>, and anti-slavery novels.
                           For each subgenre, one or several works were predefined as prototypes,
                           following literary-historical indications of their status as ideal types,
                           either as predecessors or as masterpieces and culminations of the subgenres
                           in question. Subsequently, textual similarities of all the novels to the
                           different prototypical works were analyzed based on MFW and topic features.
                           The analysis faced the difficulty that especially the predecessor prototypes
                           can have their origin in other countries (for example, novels from Spain in
                           the case of the <em>costumbrista</em> subgenre) and also in other
                           languages (such as the English “Waverley” for the historical novel or the
                           French “La Nouvelle Héloïse” for the sentimental novel). Furthermore, they
                           can also be chronologically distant from the follower works. “La Nouvelle
                           Héloïse”, for instance, was first published in the eighteenth century. To be
                           able to compare works that were originally written in other languages,
                           Spanish translations of them were used, but it is clear that such cultural,
                           historical, and linguistic differences significantly complicate comparisons
                           of literary texts on a stylistic level. Therefore, it is not surprising that
                           there was a tendency for the follower works to be more similar to each other
                           than each of them was to the respective prototype. In addition, the
                           stylistic coherence of the works of individual subgenres was not clearly
                           visible in all cases, which means that their integrity as textual genres
                           could not be confirmed with certainty.</p>

                           relationships are not necessarily translatable to a stylistic level. The
                           results of the prototype analysis of the nineteenth-century subgenres of
                           Spanish-American novels also suggest that works which are considered
                           prototypical from a literary-historical point of view might rather be
                           exceptional than typical for a textual genre. Therefore, it could be more
                           useful to look for a prototypical textual core not in the sense of
                           excellent, norm-founding masterpieces but ordinary, average works.</p>
                        
                        <p id="p112"><span class="paracount w3-blue-grey w3-margin-right"><a href="#p112">112</a></span>Considering how computational categorization methods in
                           general relate to prototype structures versus logical classes, it can be
                           noted that there is no direct and exclusive relationship between one method
                           and one theoretical concept of genre categories. The two main types of text
                           categorization methods that are used in machine learning and statistical
                           text analysis are classification and clustering. As classification is a
                           supervised method, its aim is to separate the data points in a way that fits
                           best to the class labels provided with the data. As long as only one label
                           is allowed per data point, the results are exclusive classes that do not
                           overlap. So, at a first glance, it seems that statistical text
                           classification is entirely congruent with the idea of treating genres as
                           classes in the logical sense. Looking closer reveals that statistical
                           classification procedures can also be related to prototypical structures.
                           First, many classification algorithms include calculating scores or
                           probabilities for the class assignments, which means that internally,
                           information is collected about the degree to which an instance can be
                           considered as belonging to one class or another, before the final decision
                           for the output is made.<sup id="ftn79" class="w3-btn w3-theme-l3 w3-circle" onclick="document.getElementById('ftn79-modal').style.display='block'">79</sup> This
                           internal data can be interpreted as information about the prototypicality of
                           data points for classes. If classification is used to predict the genre of
                           literary works, the probability with which a certain work is assigned to one
                           genre or the other can also be understood as its proximity or distance to a
                           prototypical core of the genre. Second, the features used for statistical
                           classification are usually not only binary but numerical. When numerical and
                           especially continuous numerical features are involved, decisions are not
                           based on the presence or absence of features but on feature distributions
                           that can be similar or more distant from each other. In the output, the
                           classes have clear boundaries, but they have a complex structure internally.
                           The internal structure of the classes is close to how the prototype effect
                           is described theoretically in linguistics:

                                 the binary constructs of the classical approach. Consider the ratio
                                 of width to depth. The ratio is a continuous variable. Labov’s
                                 results show that associated with each of the categories <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">cup</span>, <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">bowl</span>, and

                                 value, or range of values, for the width-depth ratio. In
                                 categorizing an entity, it is not a question of ascertaining
                                 whether the entity possesses this attribute or not, but how closely

                           combinations of values are determined quantitatively. If a model is trained
                           with data that shows a concentration of similar values, value ranges, or
                           value combinations for a class, this subspace of features can be interpreted
                           as the prototypical core of the category to which new instances that are to
                           be classified are related. However, the ultimate goal of supervised
                           classification is not to produce models of prototypically structured
                           categories but to define models that separate the data along the lines of
                           the predefined labels that the training data has and to predict membership
                           in distinct classes. Carried over to the definition of genres, it means that
                           what is learned are text types that correspond as closely as possible to the
                           conventional genres – assuming that the labels are expressions of generic
                           conventions. The text types have clear boundaries, but are (usually) not
                           constituted based on of binary features. The model of the text type can be
                           applied to new literary texts to test whether they comply with it or not.
                           True positives can be interpreted as literary works that belong to the text
                           type and the conventional genre and hence to the textual genre. True
                           negatives belong neither to the text type nor to the conventional genre nor
                           the textual genre in question. False positives are part of the text type but
                           not of the conventional genre and, therefore, also not of the textual genre.
                           False negatives are part of the conventional genre but not of the text type
                           and, consequently, also not of the textual genre. Probabilities can be used
                           to check how certain the assignment of a text to the text type is and,
                           thereby, how close it comes to the prototypical core of the text type.<sup id="ftn81" class="w3-btn w3-theme-l3 w3-circle" onclick="document.getElementById('ftn81-modal').style.display='block'">81</sup> However, nothing is said about
                           prototypes of the conventional genre in such a classificatory setting.
                           Prototypicality on the level of convention (and also tradition) is
                           inaccessible to text classification with stylistic features as long as it is
                           not explicitly modeled in the metadata and available in the form of specific
                           genre labels. The cognitive aspect of the prototype model, which involves
                           recognizing instances of categories as a whole and not only as a sum of its
                           parts, is also out of scope for text stylistic categorization: “Finally, it
                           emerges very clearly from Labov’s experiment that no one single attribute,
                           or set of attributes, is essential for distinguishing the one category from
                           the other. Presence of a handle, or function in the drinking of coffee,
                           merely raises the probability that an entity will be categorized as a cup”

                           can be done is to make clear on which level, textual or non-textual,
                           literary texts are participating in genres or not. The crux with the
                           proposed interpretation of classification results in terms of text types,
                           conventional genres, and textual genres is that it presupposes a good
                           quality of the model. If, for instance, only an overall accuracy of 60&nbsp;% is
                           reached – is this a sign that the model was not properly trained? Or is it a
                           sign that the conventional genre expressed through the class labels does not
                           correspond to a congruent text type? In such a case, further experimentation
                           and examination of the results are needed, including an analysis of the

                           algorithms, the number of clusters to learn has to be set as a parameter
                           value.<sup id="ftn84" class="w3-btn w3-theme-l3 w3-circle" onclick="document.getElementById('ftn84-modal').style.display='block'">84</sup> Some aspects of clustering
                           methods remind us of prototypically organized categories. Each cluster can
                           be interpreted as a category, and their centroids as the ideal prototypes,
                           which represent (but are not equal to) the most typical exemplars of the
                           category. Clusters are formed based on continuous distance relationships
                           between data points and cluster centroids. This corresponds to the idea of
                           prototype categories where some members are central and others marginal. A
                           difference is, however, that clustering results in separate categories which
                           have clear boundaries. However, for single data points, it is possible to
                           calculate the distances to several centroids. That way the cluster
                           boundaries can be crossed when the model is interpreted.</p>
                        
                        <p id="p115"><span class="paracount w3-blue-grey w3-margin-right"><a href="#p115">115</a></span>How could clustering algorithms such as K-means be applied to
                           analyze literary texts and their genres as prototypical structures? The
                           clusters that are found can be interpreted as literary text types that have
                           a prototypical core. The texts that are members of the clusters can be seen
                           as members of the text type with certain proximity or distance to the
                           prototype. In contrast to statistical classification, though, the clustering
                           algorithms determine the text types only through the analysis of feature
                           values and distributions and not by optimizing the relationship between text
                           types and conventional literary genres, because no genre labels are used in
                           the clustering process. Once there is a model of clusters, genre labels can
                           be applied afterward to evaluate to what extent the text types overlap with
                           the conventional genres. The resulting intersections can be interpreted as
                           textual genres. An expectation is that the conventional genres will tend to
                           appear as textually more fragmented when the models are not forced to take
                           into account the traditional genre labels. Therefore, the unsupervised
                           categorization is better suited to detect discrepancies between conventional
                           and textual genres than the supervised approach. However, it is less useful
                           to learn which textual features constitute the common basis for specific
                           conventional genres. Considering the status of the prototypes that are
                           determined through the calculation of cluster centers, they are not to be
                           confounded with literary works that have been described as prototypical and
                           especially influential for a genre by literary historians or that were
                           considered as such by contemporary writers. Instead, these are statistical
                           means of text types and can be viewed as representing the most normal
                           textual characteristics for a literary type. It can be concluded that
                           clustering algorithms are closer to the idea of prototype structures than
                           classification methods, but of course they are also limited to the aspects
                           of categories that are detectable through the textual surface and text
                           style.</p>

                           to conceptualizing genre categories is discussed here: family resemblance
                           networks. The idea to describe categories in analogy to family resemblances
                           goes back to Wittgenstein. In his linguistic-philosophical work, the concept
                           serves to describe linguistic activities involving the use of the same word
                           for phenomena which only have partial and indirect similarities, like the
                           resemblances that can be seen between different members of a family: 
                           <blockquote>
                              Consider, for example, the activities that we call ‘games’. I mean
                              board-games, card-games, ball-games, athletic games, and so on. What
                              is common to them all?—Don’t say: ‘They <em>must</em> have
                              something in common, or they would not be called ‘games’’—but
                              <em>look and see</em> whether there is anything common to all.
                              For if you look at them, you won’t see something that is common to
                              <em>all</em>, but similarities, affinities, and a whole series
                              of them at that [...]. And the upshot of these considerations is: we
                              see a complicated network of similarities overlapping and
                              criss-crossing [...]. I can think of no better expression to
                              characterize these similarities than ‘family resemblance’; for the
                              various resemblances between members of a family—build, features,
                              colour of eyes, gait, temperament, and so on and so forth—overlap and
                              criss-cross in the same way.—And I shall say: ‘games’ form a
                              family.

                           conceptualized as a network of overlapping – but not in all cases common –
                           similarities. The family resemblance analogy was adopted in literary genre
                           theory already in the 1960s. It became popular because it allowed for more
                           open definitions of genre, able to overcome the necessity that the features
                           relevant to a genre should be present in all literary works attributed to
                           it. Such an open concept of genre categories is especially useful for
                           capturing changes in genres over time. These often entail that the same
                           generic term is applied to literary works with quite different textual
                           characteristics between one period and another. The gradual process of
                           change can be understood as a chain of links between individual works in a
                           network, which can be followed. While immediate neighbors in the network
                           share some features, this must no longer be true for distant relationships.
                           However, the details of applying the notion of family resemblance to
                           literary genre theory are not always laid out, even if the approach is
                           mentioned as a possible option by literary theorists. Often, the term is
                           invoked briefly as a counter-concept to logical classes, which are seen as
                           insufficient for the theoretical representation of historically variable
                           genres, for example by Jauß: 
                           <blockquote>
                              The continually new ‘widening of the genre’, in which Croce saw
                              the supposed validity of definitional and normative genre concepts led
                              ad absurdum, describes from another perspective the processlike
                              appearance and ‘legitimate transitoriness’ of literary genres, as soon
                              as one is prepared to desubstantialize the classical concept of genre.
                              This demands that one ascribe no other generality to literary ‘genres’
                              [...] than that which manifests itself in the course of its historical
                              appearance. By no means must everything generically general – what
                              allows a group of texts to appear as similar or related – be dismissed
                              [...]. Following this line of thought, literary genres are to be
                              understood not as <em>genera</em> (classes) in the logical senses,
                              but rather as <em>groups</em> or <em>historical
                                 families</em>.

                           resemblance concept also serves to defend the idea of literary genres per se
                           against the critics who question it entirely. Critics make reference to the
                           constant processes of transformation which are at work when individual works
                           refer to genre conventions and when these individual works contribute to the
                           genre’s modification at the same time. More recently, there has been some
                           consensus that literary genres are not to be equated with logical classes.
                           Fowler gives an overview of the genre concepts that prevailed in the history
                           of genre theory. He takes the position that understanding genres as a means
                           of classification is an error. He sees a practical value in using genres for
                           taxonomic efforts but argues that the principal value of genres is
                           functional: “genres have to do with identifying and communicating rather
                           than with defining and classifying. We identify the genre to interpret the
                           exemplar. [...] If we see <em>The Jew of Malta</em> as a savage farce,
                           our response will not be the same as if we saw it as a tragedy” (<span class="w3-tooltip w3-border-bottom w3-border-blue-grey">Fowler 1982, 38<span class="w3-text w3-tag w3-round w3-blue-grey w3-left-align w3-padding w3-large" style="position:absolute;left:0;bottom:25px">Fowler, Alastair. 1982. <em>Kinds of Literature.

                           genres is maintained. To view “The Jew of Malta” either as a savage farce or
                           as a tragedy would mean to view it in light of two different conventional
                           genres connected with different discursive expectations towards the text. In
                           a stylistic analysis, the text would be grouped together with other
                           instances of the conventional genre in question. Depending on the
                           perspective formed by the selection of other texts and features, different
                           textual clues and “normative facts” can be found as traces of the
                           conventional genres. This does not mean that the chosen generic perspective
                           must lead to the definition of a textual genre based on necessary common
                           features and a definition that fits all exemplars associated with the
                           corresponding conventional genre. However, it is also not excluded from the
                           outset that there can be textual similarities in addition to to the
                           conventional genre’s functional and non-textual communicative
                           characteristics. Fowler goes on to say that the missing necessary common
                           features of genres make their definitions impossible: “Either defining
                           characteristics are absent altogether, or they are limited to meager
                           distinctions that do no more than subdivide the genre. In short, genres at
                           all levels are positively resistant to definition” (<span class="w3-tooltip w3-border-bottom w3-border-blue-grey">Fowler 1982, 40<span class="w3-text w3-tag w3-round w3-blue-grey w3-left-align w3-padding w3-large" style="position:absolute;left:0;bottom:25px">Fowler, Alastair. 1982. <em>Kinds of Literature.

                           resemblance then appears as a solution that allows for describing
                           connections between literary texts participating in the same genre without
                           needing to define what their common characteristics are: “It promises to

                           far-flung resemblances between widely divergent works [...]. Genres appear

                           for conceptualizing genres as families, he sees a need to modify
                           Wittgenstein’s concept of family resemblances. According to Fowler, in its
                           original form, it would entirely impede generalizations about literary
                           forms. Fowler criticizes that Wittgenstein focuses on “directly exhibited
                           resemblances” and suggests instead focusing on the traditional links between
                           literary works: “What produces generic resemblances, reflection soon shows,
                           is tradition: a sequence of influence and imitation and inherited codes
                           connecting works in a genre. As kinship makes a family, so literary
                           relations of this sort form a genre” (<span class="w3-tooltip w3-border-bottom w3-border-blue-grey">Fowler 1982, 42<span class="w3-text w3-tag w3-round w3-blue-grey w3-left-align w3-padding w3-large" style="position:absolute;left:0;bottom:25px">Fowler, Alastair. 1982. <em>Kinds of Literature.

                           addresses the conventional level of genres. Traditional references between
                           the works are a prerequisite to treating them as members of a family, which
                           limits the possibilities of the network to cover just everything. However,
                           it also means that the conventional genre precedes literary text types.
                           Comparing Fowler’s concept to Fricke’s definition of genre, the level of
                           convention is not dependent on the textual level but the other way around.
                           Still, it is not entirely clear how Fowler delimits a common tradition (and
                           a common generic convention) because he cautions: 
                           <blockquote>
                              In its modified form, the theory of family resemblance also
                              suggests that we should be on the lookout for unexhibited, unobvious,
                              underlying connections between the features (and the works) of a
                              genre. As with heredity, with generic tradition too we have to expect
                              quite unconscious processes to be at work, besides those that readers
                              are aware of. It would be strange if genre did not in part operate
                              unconsciously, like other coding systems within language and
                              literature.

                           unexhibited. So the common literary tradition must be understood in a wide
                           sense, for example, as a common temporal, geographical, or cultural context.
                           Usefully the common literary tradition can also be understood as a common
                           major genre in which the works that are part of the family network
                           participate, but then the traditional links are quite loose again.</p>

                           tradition, for instance, by building a corpus that represents it and
                           categorizing the texts based on textual features, digital genre stylistics
                           can contribute to uncovering the underlying connections between the texts.
                           In order to formalize the family resemblance concept, this needs to be done
                           not by presupposing necessary common features or feature values and
                           distributions that are similar for all the texts in a group at once but by
                           allowing indirect and overlapping similarities. This is possible with
                           network analysis. A proposal for such a textual “family resemblance
                           analysis” is made in <a href="ch4.html#ch4.2.2.2">chapter
                              4.2.2.2</a>, where it is applied to subgenres of nineteenth-century
                           Spanish-American novels. The families are subgroups in the entire network,
                           and they can be delimited because some regions in the network are
                           interconnected more closely than others. With that, it is possible to define
                           literary text types based on family resemblance relationships. These text
                           types can be related to conventional literary genres so that
                           non-classificatory textual genres become definable. The recourse to
                           stylistic networks as an alternative method for category building solves
                           several problems:

                           dominant trend in modern critical theory, with its stress on the flexible

                           with, all three concepts of genres as categories – genres as logical
                           classes, prototype categories, and family resemblance networks – are seen as
                           heuristic tools that can be employed in digital stylistic analyses of genre.

                           and overlaps with conventional genres in the form of textual genres. In the
                           previous chapter on the system and history of genres, the issue was raised
                           about where to draw a line between different literary text types and
                           different textual genres in relationship to conventional genres. This
                           question can have different answers depending on the chosen categorization

                           will be more closely attached to the conventional genre expressed by the
                           genre labels so that some internal variation in the category might be
                           covered. With unsupervised clustering, the expectation is that if the number
                           of clusters is optimized and not fixed beforehand, there will be more text
                           types than conventional genres. The text types are expected to represent the
                           genre-internal or cross-genre textual variation more closely but are more
                           distant from conventional genre groupings. The same is assumed for a family
                           resemblance network analysis, only that this approach is even more flexible
                           in allowing for partial similarities, which might lead to text types that
                           can be related to conventional genres in a more meaningful way. However,
                           these assumptions need to be checked and substantiated by empirical work to
                           determine which of the concepts suits which historical genres best on the
                           textual level. Even if it is expected that the more open concepts of
                           prototypes and family resemblances are, in general, better suited to
                           describe the internal structure and variability of historical, literary text
                           types, classification has its value. It can help to find a good feature
                           basis by which the text types can be linked to conventional genres and use
                           that basis as a starting point for the more open procedures. Classification

                           digital genre stylistics. Even other, non-categorizing approaches, for

                           formalized in digital genre stylistics so far. It is important to link key
                           discussions of literary genre theory to digital genre stylistics so that
                           research results of the two areas are confronted more deeply. This can
                           increase the interest of the two disciplines in each other and also
                           challenge the findings achieved in both of them. As with the definitions of
                           text types and genres, also the concepts of genre categorization and the
                           possibilities for their implementation are crucial points of contact between
                           literary genre theory and digital genre stylistics.</p>

                  <p id="p127"><span class="paracount w3-blue-grey w3-margin-right"><a href="#p127">127</a></span>Especially the last two of these definitions are relevant for
                     corpus-based computational genre stylistics. The notion of contrast is decisive
                     because the usual procedure to delimit genres as text categories is to compare
                     texts associated with the genre one is interested in with texts that participate
                     in other genres on a similar level (for example, the level of thematic subgenres).
                     Another possibility is to compare texts of one genre with texts that are part of a
                     more general generic context enclosing the genre of interest (for example,
                     comparing crime novels to a set of other novels). The style of the genre or
                     subgenre in question is always defined relative to other elements in a corpus.
                     Suppose the whole literary production covered by the broader context of the corpus
                     is considered representative of a general norm. In that case, the style of a genre
                     can be captured as a subnorm, which deviates from the general one, or as a norm
                     that contrasts with other subnorms. Regarding the relationship between text style
                     and genre, the <em>norm</em> is understood as the set of <em>normative
                        facts</em> that can be extracted from the texts. These are traces of and
                     represent the conventional and communicative norms of genres. The last notion of
                     style that Herrmann et al. list provides the basis for the kind of style and the
                     kind of normative facts that can be identified in the texts: any property that can
                     be measured with computational means. The target property can be, for example,
                     author style, genre style, or the style of a certain literary period. If it can be
                     measured, it must be possible to capture it through the linguistic surface of the
                     texts. This can be done either directly, when specific words, characters, or
                     syntactic constructions are counted, or indirectly, for example, when textual cues
                     are interpreted in terms of higher order features such as topics, which in turn
                     are interpreted as elements of the target style. Text structure that is
                     interpretable from the surface can also be subsumed under the idea of
                     computationally tractable text elements that can serve to define a target style.
                     This would include, for instance, chapters, headings, paragraphs, lists, tables,
                     typographically marked quotes, or passages of direct speech. The computational
                     treatment of such structures can be facilitated through textual markup. From a
                     computational perspective, metadata that summarizes textual aspects is, in the
                     first place, not considered part of the text stylistic features. For instance, if
                     the narrative perspective of a text is captured in a metadata item as the result
                     of a close reading process or based on external literary-historical information,
                     this textual aspect would only be linked to style if it also can be induced from
                     specific textual surface features. The target level of style (author, genre,
                     period, etc.) is usually settled on an extra-textual level of the wider
                     communicative context of the texts. Then again, author styles, genre styles, and
                     the styles of periods can be recognized in texts, which means that such
                     influencing factors can be assumed to be tractable in the texts through
                     consciously used text properties as well as unconsciously left linguistic
                     marks.</p>
                  
                  <p id="p128"><span class="paracount w3-blue-grey w3-margin-right"><a href="#p128">128</a></span>In the context of genre, Schaeffer differentiates between three
                     kinds of text properties. In his terms, “generic indexes” are signals that are
                     mainly found in paratexts of the works or the literary context and whose function
                     is metatextual and demonstrative (for example, the label “novela de costumbres”).
                     “Generic traits” are textual properties and have a structural and
                     non-demonstrative function (for instance, verse structure in sonnets). “Generic
                     markers” are textual traces of factors that are part of the communicative level
                     and exemplify an intentional property (such a factor would, for example, be a
                     satiric attitude) (<span class="w3-tooltip w3-border-bottom w3-border-blue-grey">Schaeffer 1983,
                        174–175<span class="w3-text w3-tag w3-round w3-blue-grey w3-left-align w3-padding w3-large" style="position:absolute;left:0;bottom:25px">Schaeffer, Jean-Marie. 1983. <em>Qu’est-ce qu’un
                              genre littéraire?</em> Paris: Seuil.</span></span>). Transferred to the idea of text style, <em>traits</em> can
                     be understood as general text structural properties and <em>stylistic
                        markers</em> as surface cues that can be linked to pragmatic properties.
                     <em>Stylistic indexes</em> can be conceived as stylistic features of the
                     conventional level, which influence the perception of style but are not
                     necessarily congruent with certain traits or markers. A conventional genre label
                     would, for example, be an index for a certain genre style. In his set of terms,
                     Schaeffer brings in different communicative levels: the “structural” level, by
                     which he probably means the syntactic and semantic textual level versus the
                     pragmatic level. He uses the terms to distinguish between properties that are
                     somehow inherent and constitutive of texts (the traits) and others that are
                     present as traces of communicative functions of the texts (the markers). However,
                     he does not differentiate between the linguistic surface level and higher-order
                     textual characteristics, at least not explicitly. This means that a
                     structural-semantic text property, such as a certain number of characters in a
                     dramatic play, could be called a trait in the same way as the use of certain types
                     of nouns, for example, a scientific vocabulary in a naturalistic novel. For a
                     computational analysis concerned with stylistic properties, such a distinction
                     would be useful to differentiate between properties of texts in general and
                     properties of text style. Furthermore, on the linguistic surface, everything is
                     the same. It is difficult to explain or decide which features are due to the
                     conscious structuring and design of texts and which ones are unconsciously
                     employed or stemming from pragmatic intentions or other text-external factors.
                     Because of these difficulties in describing text style, Schaeffer’s distinction
                     between <em>traits</em> and <em>markers</em> is not directly employed
                     here.</p>
                  
                  <p id="p129"><span class="paracount w3-blue-grey w3-margin-right"><a href="#p129">129</a></span>A terminology that covers similar aspects of describing the
                     connection between textual patterns and literary theoretical or conventional
                     conceptions of genres has been proposed by Kessler, Numberg, and Schütze: 
                     <blockquote>
                        The traditional literature on genre is rich with classificatory schemes
                        and systems, some of which might in retrospect be analyzed as simple
                        attribute systems. [...] We will refer here to the attributes used in
                        classifying genres as GENERIC FACETS. A facet is simply a property which
                        distinguishes a class of texts that answers to certain practical interests,
                        and which is moreover associated with a characteristic set of computable
                        structural or linguistic properties, whether categorical or statistical,
                        which we will describe as ‘generic cues.’ In principle, a given text can be
                        described in terms of an indefinitely large number of facets. For example, a
                        newspaper story about a Balkan peace initiative is an example of a BROADCAST
                        as opposed to DIRECTED communication, a property that correlates formally
                        with certain uses of the pronoun <em>you</em>. It is also an example of
                        a NARRATIVE, as opposed to a DIRECTIVE (e.g., in a manual), SUASIVE (as in
                        an editorial), or DESCRIPTIVE (as in a market survey) communication: and
                        this facet correlates, among other things, with a high incidence of
                        preterite verb forms.

                        facets</em> and <em>generic cues</em>. They use the first term to refer
                     to higher-order attributes that are used to distinguish texts of a certain class
                     from those belonging to a different class. If one interprets the examples that
                     Kessler, Numberg, and Schütze give, one concludes that they understand facets as
                     applying to the text as a whole and not to specific parts of it. Furthermore, the
                     facets that Kessler, Numberg, and Schütze mention are themselves functional
                     linguistic text types (“broadcast” versus “directed communication”; “narrative”,
                     “directive”, “suasive”, “descriptive”) or, from the point of view of literary
                     genre, modes which are understood as attributes of genres (“newspaper story”).
                     Facets are characteristics that are not to be equated with specific linguistic
                     traits of the text but are connected to them. The latter are the <em>generic
                        cues</em>. The authors assume that generic facets are computationally and
                     linguistically tractable through their cues. The advantage of Kessler, Numberg,
                     and Schütze’s terminology for a text stylistic analysis is that they provide an
                     own term for features of the structural-linguistic surface. Their term “cues” will
                     also be employed here to designate low-level stylistic features. The meaning of
                     the term “facets”, though, should be described in a more differentiated and
                     comprehensive manner. Here it is preferred to call the examples that Kessler,
                     Numberg, and Schütze give (narrative, directive, descriptive) either functional
                     text types – from the linguistic point of view – or modes – from the point of view
                     of literary genre theory. The term “facets” can include these if they are meant as
                     pragmatic textual properties of genres, but there can also be other types of
                     facets. At the beginning of their article, Kessler, Numberg, and Schütze describe
                     facets as “attributes used in classifying genres” (<span class="w3-tooltip w3-border-bottom w3-border-blue-grey">Kessler, Numberg, and Schütze 1997, 33<span class="w3-text w3-tag w3-round w3-blue-grey w3-left-align w3-padding w3-large" style="position:absolute;left:0;bottom:25px">Kessler, Brett, Geoffrey Numberg, and Hinrich

                     these can, in principle, be of any type. Returning to the examples of the number
                     of characters in a dramatic play or the use of scientific vocabulary in a
                     naturalistic novel, these two aspects can both be understood as facets if they are
                     attributes that are ascribed to genre categories and if they can be linked to
                     surface cues. However, “the use of scientific vocabulary” can commonly be
                     considered an element of style, and there is a direct relationship of this facet
                     to cues (the specific words that are part of scientific vocabulary). In contrast,
                     the facet “a high number of characters in a comedy” would commonly not be treated
                     as style and is much further away from surface cues (it would need to be mapped to
                     mentions of character names and the use of personal pronouns, for instance). To
                     give another example, the narrative perspective of a text, for instance, can be
                     perceived as part of a text’s style but is also primarily situated on a pragmatic
                     level: it is signaled that the whole narrative text or major parts of it are
                     designed to be narrated in a certain perspective. This has effects on the
                     syntagmatic realization of the text, for instance, the use of pronouns and verb
                     forms in a certain person in the narrated text. Therefore, the relationship of the
                     “narrative perspective” facet to surface cues is also more mediated than in the
                     case of “the use of scientific vocabulary”. Here, facets are considered as
                     attributes of the target category of style (e.g., genre, author, period, etc.) but
                     not themselves elements of style. The term “stylistic traits” is introduced to
                     designate elements of style that can be more abstract than surface cues but are
                     still attributes of how the text is represented syntagmatically (that is,
                     structurally, linguistically, syntactically, and by surface semantics). A certain
                     narrative perspective can then be conceived as a facet when it is used to
                     characterize a genre or some other category and as a stylistic trait that can be
                     linked to stylistic cues. A high number of characters in a comedy can also be a
                     facet, but it is not considered a stylistic trait. However, if it can be linked to
                     stylistic cues, it can influence style. A high number of character mentions in a
                     comedy, in contrast, can be a stylistic trait because it is situated on the level
                     of the linguistic representation of the text. In the following, the terms “facet”,
                     “stylistic trait”, and “stylistic cue” are used here.</p>

                     concept for computational, quantitative, and empirical studies of style in
                     literary texts: “Style is a property of texts constituted by an ensemble of formal

                     also differentiated and elaborated for the purpose of computational and
                     quantitative stylistic genre analysis:

                        <li>Literary genre style is a property of literary texts constituted by an
                           ensemble of observable features, feature values, and distributions, which is
                           distinctive for the literary text type that the texts belong to and, by
                           extension, widely congruent with the conventional literary genre that the
                           texts participate in.</li>
                        
                        <li>The features can be directly described as formal low-level stylistic
                           cues, which are measurable as structural, syntactic, functional, or semantic
                           linguistic surface features, or as higher-level stylistic traits, which can
                           be induced from the low-level cues. Both stylistic cues and stylistic traits
                           can be linked to facets, which are attributes of textual genres.</li>
                        
                        <li>In a wide sense, all kinds of linguistic features are considered
                           stylistic cues; in a narrow sense, purely semantic features are
                           excepted.</li>
                        </ul>
                     </p>
                  
                  <p id="p132"><span class="paracount w3-blue-grey w3-margin-right"><a href="#p132">132</a></span>Being less general, the definition directly addresses literary genre
                     style and defines it in terms of the textual genre as the intersection of text
                     type and conventional genre. Furthermore, feature values and distributions are
                     added to make clear that presence or absence is not the only possible form of
                     features and also that specific feature combinations can be decisive. That the
                     ensemble of features should be distinctive means that it can be used to
                     distinguish between different genre categories on the textual level. To be able to
                     speak about the style of a certain literary genre, it is required that there is
                     considerable overlap between the corresponding text type and conventional genre.
                     This is formulated vaguely as “widely”, so that the necessary degree of
                     intersection needs to be discussed in each case. Nevertheless, an overlap of more
                     than 50&nbsp;% can be taken as a minimum. For the features, a difference is made
                     between formal, low-level stylistic cues and higher-level stylistic traits to make
                     clear that there can be different degrees of abstraction from the textual surface.
                     Linguistic low-level features (<em>stylistic cues</em>) are, for example, the
                     number of pronouns, n-grams, or collocations of a specific type. A linguistic
                     higher-order feature (<em>stylistic trait</em>) is, for instance, the number
                     of descriptive or argumentative passages in a text. For the stylistic traits, a
                     link to the stylistic cues must be established to make sure that they are
                     observable and computationally measurable. Typical literary features can also
                     correspond to cues, for example, rhyme structures or other rhetoric means.
                     However, it is more common for literary features to be defined on a higher level,
                     stylistic or non-stylistic (for instance, narrative perspective, character
                     constellations, or plot elements).<sup id="ftn92" class="w3-btn w3-theme-l3 w3-circle" onclick="document.getElementById('ftn92-modal').style.display='block'">92</sup> For the
                     higher-order features, it is not easy to draw a strict line between features that
                     can still be considered (indirectly) observable and those that are mainly
                     interpretable. In this respect, too, it will be necessary in each case to discuss
                     the nature of the features: if they are stylistic traits or not and if they can be
                     linked to stylistic cues or not. Finally, the third part of the definition splits
                     the concept of literary genre style into a wide one, including all kinds of
                     linguistic cues, and a narrower one excluding semantic cues. This distinction is
                     made to be able to characterize features more precisely as being primarily
                     structural and functional or as being related to the content of the texts as well.
                     To what extent can semantic cues be understood as elements of a text’s style? The
                     concept of style would be overstretched considerably if elements of the content of
                     a literary text, such as the type and number of characters involved, the basic
                     theme, setting, or the underlying sequence of events of the story, would directly
                     be declared stylistic features. In the first place, these are considered textual
                     facets here that can be part of genre definitions. However, if such elements are
                     assessed and described as they occur on the textual surface (via stylistic traits
                     or directly linked to stylistic cues), it seems legitimate to include them in a
                     broad definition of formal textual style because the same story involving the same
                     content-related elements can be told differently. It may vary, for example, how
                     often the characters are mentioned explicitly by their name or through which
                     textual topics or motives the theme of a text is expressed. One may decide to
                     include such elements in using a wide concept of style or to exclude them by
                     adhering to a narrower style definition.</p>
                  
                  <p id="p133"><span class="paracount w3-blue-grey w3-margin-right"><a href="#p133">133</a></span>Some observations can be made concerning the relationship of the
                     style definition to different types of categorization. Following the class
                     concept, the above definition of literary genre style entails that a clear line
                     can be drawn between one group of texts and others based on how an ensemble of
                     formal features is constituted in these texts. In the prototype setup, the genre
                     style would be defined based on a prototypical constitution of an ensemble of
                     formal features. The other texts belonging to the same or to other textual genres
                     would be situated relatively to this central feature constitution. From a family
                     resemblance perspective, genre style can be understood as a set of related
                     ensembles of formal features linked via parts of the various feature
                     ensembles.</p>

                     subgenres of those novels on the level of metadata and text. The empirical work
                     and findings are presented in <a href="ch3.html">chapter 3</a>,
                     where the bibliography and corpus are described, and in <a href="ch4.html">chapter 4</a>, which contains the metadata and text analysis of
                     the novels and their subgenres. Novels from three countries, Argentina, Cuba, and
                     Mexico, were selected for the analysis, and diachronically, the bibliography and
                     the corpus are limited to 1830–1910. Both the literary-historical developments of
                     the time and the historical, political, and geographical context are discussed in
                     the corpus chapter, where the choice of the countries and the time period are
                     explained. In addition, the general defining characteristics of the novels in

                     nineteenth-century Spanish-American novels as they are defined, described and
                     discussed in literary-historical research, independently of and preceding the

                     novel (<em>novela histórica</em>), the novel of manners or customs
                     (<em>novela de costumbres</em>), and the sentimental novel (<em>novela
                        sentimental</em>). Subsequently, three subgenres related to literary currents
                     are introduced: the romantic novel (<em>novela romántica</em>), the realist
                     novel (<em>novela realista</em>), and the naturalistic novel (<em>novela
                        naturalista</em>). As argued before, literary currents can be described as
                     conventional literary genres, as well, and potentially even as textual literary
                     genres.<sup id="ftn94" class="w3-btn w3-theme-l3 w3-circle" onclick="document.getElementById('ftn94-modal').style.display='block'">94</sup> Of
                     course, these are not the only subgenres of Spanish-American novels in the
                     nineteenth century, and the metadata analysis of the corpus and bibliography shows
                     a great variety of them. However, they are the most important ones on the two
                     discursive levels of theme and literary current from a quantitative perspective
                     and have therefore been chosen for text analysis. Furthermore, they have
                     repeatedly been treated in literary histories and other literary-historical
                     research about nineteenth-century Spanish-American literature, which is not the
                     case for all the other different subgenres of the novel found in the database that
                     was created for this study. The correlation between their quantitative importance
                     and the critical interest in them is probably not accidental.</p>
                  
                  <p id="p136"><span class="paracount w3-blue-grey w3-margin-right"><a href="#p136">136</a></span>As the chosen subgenres also existed and exist outside of the
                     Spanish-American tradition, especially in the European countries, there is a
                     wealth of research literature on each one of them. It cannot be taken into
                     consideration in its entirety, so the presentation of the subgenres concentrates
                     on the three chosen countries. General histories of Latin- and Spanish-American
                     literature and novels are also taken into account but primarily for general
                     statements about the subgenres in question and not to analyze them for all the
                     countries of the region. There are monographs on some of the subgenres that are
                     specialized in the nineteenth century and either cover Spanish America as a whole
                     or one of the three countries Argentina, Cuba, and Mexico. Most of them are
                     concerned with the literary currents.<sup id="ftn95" class="w3-btn w3-theme-l3 w3-circle" onclick="document.getElementById('ftn95-modal').style.display='block'">95</sup> Of the thematic subgenres, the historical novel has
                     been the focus of literary-historical work. However, no monographic studies could
                     be found for the <em>novela de costumbres</em> and the <em>novela
                        sentimental</em> in Spanish America in the nineteenth century.<sup id="ftn96" class="w3-btn w3-theme-l3 w3-circle" onclick="document.getElementById('ftn96-modal').style.display='block'">96</sup></p>

                     literary-historical characterization allows to formulate hypotheses about its
                     textual coherence, that is, whether or not it can be expected that the novels
                     participating in the subgenre are held together on a conventional <em>and</em>
                     textual level, and if so, which textual characteristics are significant. On the
                     other side, it is also possible that the literary-historical knowledge about a
                     subgenre suggests that textual subgroups or textual heterogeneity can be expected.
                     Yet another possiblity is that the literary-historical accounts may not be
                     suitable for formulating such hypotheses at all for some of the subgenres. In case
                     they can be developed, the hypotheses about the relationships between the
                     subgenres’ conventional and textual aspects are considered when the novels are
                     analyzed in <a href="ch4.html#ch4.2">chapter 4.2</a>. Before the
                     individual subgenres are discussed, some general considerations about the novel as
                     a genre and the Spanish-American nineteenth-century novel are made.</p>

                     other fictional narrative prose texts of considerable length, nor can additional
                     formal or content-related criteria serve to capture all types of novels (<span class="w3-tooltip w3-border-bottom w3-border-blue-grey">Fludernik 2009, 627<span class="w3-text w3-tag w3-round w3-blue-grey w3-left-align w3-padding w3-large" style="position:absolute;left:0;bottom:25px">Fludernik, Monika. 2009. “Roman.” In <em>Handbuch der

                     summarizes the status of the novel as a genre (or historical kind, in his terms):
                     
                     <blockquote>
                        A genre so comprehensive can have but a weak unitary force. Indeed the
                        novel has largely ceased to function as a kind in the ordinary way. Its
                        minimal specification has even been stated as ‘an extended piece of prose
                        fiction’—a specification in which external form appears, but only as
                        ‘extended’ and ‘prose.’ Within this enormous field, the novel in a stronger
                        sense—the verisimilar novel of Austen and Thackeray, which many would
                        consider the central tradition—is now only one of several equipollent
                        forms.

                     the case of nineteenth-century Spanish-American novels. There are some early
                     narrative prose texts that were written in the colonial era and can be considered
                     forerunners of the novel in Spanish America. However, the genre only took off
                     considerably during the nineteenth century (<span class="w3-tooltip w3-border-bottom w3-border-blue-grey">Gálvez 1990, 15–25<span class="w3-text w3-tag w3-round w3-blue-grey w3-left-align w3-padding w3-large" style="position:absolute;left:0;bottom:25px">Gálvez, Marina. 1990. <em>La novela hispanoamericana

                              Narrative.</em> Austin: University of Texas Press.</span></span>). So especially in the early
                     decades of the century, the Spanish-American novel is characterized by literary
                     experimentation, for instance, by fluctuations between very short prose forms that
                     are close to stories and excessively long serial novels published in newspapers.
                     Besides the varying length of the texts, their status as fictional works is
                     marginal in some cases as well. Up to the end of the century, many novels served
                     the need to document and discuss contemporary or past political and historical
                     events, sometimes in the form of “memories” or as concealed social critique, and
                     the novel had an important function in the process of nation building after the
                     wars of independence. This aspect is particularly relevant for Argentina and
                     Mexico, but even in the Cuban case, the novels already served identity functions
                     in the colony’s last decades. Because of the closeness of many works to
                     non-fictional discourses, the early Spanish-American novels are special, and in
                     some cases, it is difficult to draw a line between fictional and non-fictional
                     texts.<sup id="ftn97" class="w3-btn w3-theme-l3 w3-circle" onclick="document.getElementById('ftn97-modal').style.display='block'">97</sup></p>

                     Mexico in the nineteenth century, and their number increased considerably,
                     especially after 1880.<sup id="ftn98" class="w3-btn w3-theme-l3 w3-circle" onclick="document.getElementById('ftn98-modal').style.display='block'">98</sup>
                     Even before, there were more novels than the few ones usually cited as
                     representative of the nineteenth century in literary histories. Molina, for
                     example, analyses the early Argentine novel between 1838 and 1872 and finds that
                     the novels “popped up like mushrooms” (her book having the title “como crecen los
                     hongos”, referring to the commentary that an Argentina journalist made in 1860
                     about the increasing number of novels that were published). She analyzes 86 novels
                     for a period considered unproductive for the Argentine novel (<span class="w3-tooltip w3-border-bottom w3-border-blue-grey">Molina 2011, 13–17<span class="w3-text w3-tag w3-round w3-blue-grey w3-left-align w3-padding w3-large" style="position:absolute;left:0;bottom:25px">Molina, Hebe Beatriz. 2011. <em>Como crecen los hongos.

                     phenomenon, there were specific types of subgenres that were practiced by the
                     Spanish-American writers. For one thing, early Spanish-American novels were
                     influenced by European models, including types of romantic novels such as
                     sentimental novels and historical novels. At the same time, the subgenres were
                     varied to serve the needs of expression in the Spanish-American context in a
                     better way.<sup id="ftn99" class="w3-btn w3-theme-l3 w3-circle" onclick="document.getElementById('ftn99-modal').style.display='block'">99</sup> To analyze these subgenres

                     about its subgenres? Fowler concludes that “the novel is still a kind, even if one
                     badly in need of subdivision” (<span class="w3-tooltip w3-border-bottom w3-border-blue-grey">Fowler
                        1982, 120<span class="w3-text w3-tag w3-round w3-blue-grey w3-left-align w3-padding w3-large" style="position:absolute;left:0;bottom:25px">Fowler, Alastair. 1982. <em>Kinds of Literature. An

                           Press.</span></span>). The novel is rooted in many other earlier fictional and
                     non-fictional genres, such as epic, romance, history, or letter, which influence
                     its more mature forms, “giving rise in some instances to distinct subgenres” (<span class="w3-tooltip w3-border-bottom w3-border-blue-grey">Fowler 1982, 120<span class="w3-text w3-tag w3-round w3-blue-grey w3-left-align w3-padding w3-large" style="position:absolute;left:0;bottom:25px">Fowler, Alastair. 1982. <em>Kinds of Literature.

                           Press.</span></span>). So it may be the
                     case that some of the novel’s subgenres are textually more coherent than the novel
                     itself is on a general level. On the other side, subgenres of the novel can be
                     specified from a whole range of perspectives, which makes them “extremely
                     volatile. To determine the features of a subgenre is to trace a diachronic process
                     of imitation, variation, innovation—in fact, to verge on source study” (<span class="w3-tooltip w3-border-bottom w3-border-blue-grey">Fowler 1982, 114<span class="w3-text w3-tag w3-round w3-blue-grey w3-left-align w3-padding w3-large" style="position:absolute;left:0;bottom:25px">Fowler, Alastair. 1982. <em>Kinds of Literature.

                     open question whether Spanish-American nineteenth-century novels can be easily
                     separated into textual classes corresponding to their conventional subgenres or
                     whether they resist such classification. The mentioned characteristics of the
                     novel in general and of the early Spanish-American novels, in particular, suggest
                     that at least for some of the subgenres, alternative categorization approaches
                     such as the family resemblance analysis can be helpful to examine where the levels
                     of genre convention, text types, and textual genres diverge.<sup id="ftn100" class="w3-btn w3-theme-l3 w3-circle" onclick="document.getElementById('ftn100-modal').style.display='block'">100</sup> In the next two chapters on thematic subgenres and

                           marked as such in series or subtitles, which shows that the subgenre was
                           well established on a conventional level.<sup id="ftn101" class="w3-btn w3-theme-l3 w3-circle" onclick="document.getElementById('ftn101-modal').style.display='block'">101</sup> In the Spanish-American historical novels, typical topics
                           are the period of conquest, the colonial era, and the wars of independence.
                           Especially the latter are not part of a remote historical past, but in the
                           case of Mexico and Argentina, they took place in the early nineteenth
                           century itself, and for Cuba towards the end of the century. In some
                           historical novels published in Argentina, Cuba, and Mexico, a European
                           setting is chosen, for example, from Antiquity or the Middle Ages, but most
                           are concerned with local history, which is temporally more immediate. This
                           makes the Spanish-American historical novels special with regard to the
                           first general defining aspect of temporal distance because that distance is
                           not given in some cases. However, the novels are often explicitly declared
                           historical, even if the events are contemporary or took place in a very
                           recent past. Even if the more distant past of the conquest or colonial
                           period is treated, this is done differently than in European historical
                           novels: “Scott, for instance, tried to escape from his century and return to
                           a spirit of the past; Mexican historical novelists who dealt with the
                           distant past attempted to interpret that past in terms of their own

                           romantic period. It continued to be practiced towards the end of the
                           nineteenth century and also in the twentieth century. It was, for example,
                           influenced by Spanish realist and French naturalistic authors. The Mexican

                           for instance, carries the subtitle “Novela naturalista, humorística, de
                           costumbres, de crímenes y de horrores”. That it has been classified as a

                           marks it as one of the cases with a clear discrepancy between the generic
                           convention, the textual form, and the critical tradition that the works have

                           textual coherence of nineteenth-century Spanish-American historical novels.
                           First, the subgenre is long-lasting, there are numerous works attributed to
                           it and it was recognized as a subgenre by contemporaries. These factors
                           suggest that the subgenre is also stylistically distinguishable from other
                           subgenres. What might make its textual classification difficult, though, is
                           that it is often mixed with a sentimental plot and thus has characteristics
                           in common with the sentimental novels, as well. Furthermore, the novels of
                           contemporary history treat similar political and social subjects to other
                           types of novels that are not designed and communicated as historical ones.
                           In addition, stylistic differences can be expected between the early
                           romantic versus the later realist and naturalistic historical novels.
                           Moreover, the range of different special topics (conquest, colonial era,
                           wars of independence) might lead to a subdivision of the textual genre into
                           several subtypes, at least if semantic features are used to categorize the
                           texts.</p>

                           costumbres”, which had a French origin and were very popular in Spain before
                           they reached Spanish America.<sup id="ftn104" class="w3-btn w3-theme-l3 w3-circle" onclick="document.getElementById('ftn104-modal').style.display='block'">104</sup> These
                           prose texts were mainly published in journals and periodicals. In them, life
                           in urban or rural settings is described, and the male and female types of
                           different social strata are portrayed with their habits. Furthermore,
                           traditional festivities are a common topic in the texts. The
                           <em>cuadros</em> evolved to full novels retaining the same
                           characteristics. Observing the particular, the traditional, and the
                           vernacular were important concerns of the novels of customs. They were,
                           therefore, well suited to take up elements of the Spanish-American reality
                           of life and contribute to the development of a national novel.
                           Stylistically, they are characterized as creating a local color, for
                           instance, by including colloquial speech and creating a picturesque effect,

                           romantic form. In Spanish America, they were also used as a vehicle for

                           The Mexican author José Tomás de Cuéllar, for example, was a prolific writer
                           of novels of customs. He produced a whole series called “La linterna mágica”
                           (published between 1871 and 1892). The first novel of the series is preceded
                           by an introduction explaining Cuéllar’s literary program. The magical
                           lantern is a symbol for the purpose of the novels of customs. Cuéllar claims
                           that he first happened upon the expression in a small corner shop of some
                           Mexican village. This is already indicative of the aim to represent local
                           and rural customs. The lantern illuminates all kinds of spots the author
                           visits, showing the multitude of ordinary people he wants to portray. It
                           enlarges the view on vices and defects and, at the same time, minimizes the
                           size of each person so that they come to the fore above all as social
                           groups. The reader is invited to follow the lantern’s light which accepts
                           the insufficiencies of the people with humor and also presents alternative

                           “novela de costumbres” was employed show the strength of the historical
                           generic convention. However, the novels of customs are not detached from
                           other prominent thematic subgenres. Novels can be at the same time
                           historical and of customs, as for example “Calvario y Tabor. &nbsp;Novela
                           histórica y de costumbres” (1868, MX) by Vicente Riva Palacio or “Julia”
                           (1868, MX) by Manuel Martínez de Castro, which had the subtitle “novela de
                           costumbres mexicanas” in the first edition and “novela histórica y de
                           costumbres” in the second one. There is also a close relationship between
                           novels of customs and sentimental novels, as Janik points out: 
                           <blockquote>

                           types with other romantic subgenres, the novels of customs still represent
                           early forms of realistic texts. In the later nineteenth century, they
                           entered into similar relationships with the realist and naturalistic novels.
                           As Kohut notes, the delimitation of Romanticism, Realism, and Naturalism is
                           difficult in Spanish America for several reasons, one of them being the
                           <em>Costumbrismo</em> as an element between the different literary
                           currents: 
                           <blockquote>
                              Zum Realismus gehört die Zuwendung zur Gesellschaft, zur Romantik
                              die häufig idyllisierende Perspektive. [...] Wichtiger als der

                              naturalistischer Romane. So gab der Chilene Alberto Blest Gana seinem

                           traits that help to distinguish this type of novel from the other thematic
                           subgenres. However, in the literary-historical characterizations, this

                           subgenres, which might make it difficult to classify it on the basis of

                           is the sentimental novel proper. Contrary to the historical novel and the
                           <em>novela de costumbres</em>, sentimental novels are usually not
                           marked with explicit subgenre labels by authors or editors. In the whole
                           bibliography and corpus that were compiled for this study, there is just one
                           work carrying the subtitle “novela sentimental” – the novel “El canto del
                           cisne (Novela sentimental)” (1910, AR) by Roque C. Otamendi. From the point
                           of view of historical genre convention, the status of sentimental novels is,
                           therefore, different from that of historical novels and novels of customs.
                           It was a subgenre that was signaled in more subtle ways, for example, by
                           using female first names as titles, e.g., “Soledad” (1847, AR) by Mitre,
                           “Esther” (1851, AR, Cané), or “Clemencia” (1869, MX) by Altamirano.
                           Furthermore, a sentimental plot is present in the majority of the
                           nineteenth-century Spanish-American novels, which makes this subgenre one
                           that is part of a general generic repertoire of the time. It can appear in a
                           pure form or as a basic element to provide a narrative structure for novels
                           that have other, additional, or superordinate thematic objectives. It can,
                           for example, motivate descriptions of historical and contemporary conflicts
                           and settings. Because of the omnipresence of sentimental elements in
                           different kinds of novels over time, the sentimental novel has also been
                           called a “metagenre”, which might challenge the classification of novels
                           into subgenres (<span class="w3-tooltip w3-border-bottom w3-border-blue-grey">Varela Jácome [1982] 2000, sec. 1.4<span class="w3-text w3-tag w3-round w3-blue-grey w3-left-align w3-padding w3-large" style="position:absolute;left:0;bottom:25px">Varela Jácome, Benito.

                           elements of sentimental novels are letters or passages of diaries included

                           protagonists’ mental world and sensitivities. As the historical novel, also
                           the sentimental novel has European, especially French models that the
                           Spanish-American authors followed, for instance, the epistolary novel “Julie
                           ou la Nouvelle Héloïse” (1761, FR) by Rousseau, “René” (1802) by
                           Chateaubriand, or the autobiographic novel “Graziella” (1852, FR) by
                           Lamartine, but also the German epistolary novel “Die Leiden des jungen
                           Werhers” (1774) by Goethe. In the sentimental novels proper, the
                           protagonists are described in idealizing terms, emphasizing their moral
                           superiority and tending to a flowery and metaphorical style. The heroine of
                           Mitre’s novel “Soledad”, for example, is described as “imagen escapada de
                           las telas de Rafael”, “un serafín bajado del trono del Señor”, and “la
                           estatua de la castidad meditando”. Not only the protagonists but also the

                           a more realistic style. Moreover, the historical novels almost exclusively
                           have a third-person narrator. This can have a significant influence on the
                           novels’ style, at least if the textual features used for categorization
                           include personal pronouns and declined verb forms. The <em>novelas de

                           narrated in the first and half in the third person, which supports the

                           sentimental plot, but, for example, a historical setting or social and
                           political concerns, the textual distinction of the various subgenres is

                           local cultural models were missing, and also the ideological climate was

                           social, adventure, indianist novels, and also the novels of customs. That
                           different subgenres of the novel played an important role in the period in
                           which the romantic current was dominant is readily apparent from the
                           structure of many literary histories concerned with Spanish-American
                           nineteenth-century literature. Usually, the description of the romantic
                           novel is subdivided into separate sections concerned with the different
                           subgenres, which is not always the case for the later currents.<sup id="ftn107" class="w3-btn w3-theme-l3 w3-circle" onclick="document.getElementById('ftn107-modal').style.display='block'">107</sup></p>

                           several different kinds of hypotheses can be formulated. Thematically, the
                           inclusion of a sentimental story is a typical element of all kinds of
                           romantic novels and might facilitate its classification against realist and
                           naturalistic novels. Even if a sentimental plot also occurs in novels
                           belonging to the other currents, it is less typical. Then again, the clearly
                           distinguishable thematic subtypes of romantic novels lead to the assumption
                           that the conventional romantic subgenre might fall into several textual
                           subgroups if semantic features are used. In the narrow sense of linguistic
                           style, though, it is probable that the romantic novel is coherent. A
                           hypothesis is that specific parts of speech, vocabulary, and punctuation
                           marks are used to express subjectivity and emotionality, for instance, many
                           personal and possessive pronouns, qualifying adjectives and adverbs,
                           interjections, or exclamation and question marks.</p>

                           is that there are individual works that combine elements of several
                           currents. Especially romantic and realist elements are often combined, which
                           is an effect of the chronologically discontinuous integration, adaptation,
                           and further development of foreign currents in the Spanish-American
                           context.<sup id="ftn108" class="w3-btn w3-theme-l3 w3-circle" onclick="document.getElementById('ftn108-modal').style.display='block'">108</sup> Furthermore, the presence of romantic works up to the
                           end of the nineteenth century raises the question of whether there is a
                           contrast between an early and a late romantic style which could become
                           visible in the categorization of the texts.</p>

The realist movement was linked to the formulation of positivist
                           philosophical theories and the development of the natural sciences.
                           According to the positivist philosophy, new insights should derive from
                           positive findings that are sensually graspable, actually observable, and
                           verifiable. For the arts, this meant that their primary objective was to
                           reflect the social reality aesthetically by accurately depicting the
                           characters and describing the environments meticulously. In realist novels,
                           dialogues are an important means to develop the action. They are represented
                           in detail but without the need to put aside the omniscient perspective. In
                           sum, the goal was to create an effect of verisimilitude, an <em>effet de
                              réel</em>, which aimed to make the reader believe that what is
                           described is the real world. By convention, a relationship of identity is
                           assumed between the contemporary world and the mimetic fictional world. To
                           what extent the author is understood as contributing to the creation of the
                           fictional world with his constructive and imaginative work depends on how
                           closely the ideal to reflect the external world directly and mimetically is

                           (1884) written by the Argentine Lucio Vicente López. On the other hand,
                           rural environments were also a topic, for example, in the novel “La parcela”

                           the nineteenth century. Besides the novels that are directly associated with
                           this current, realistic elements are already present in earlier works. For
                           instance, the <em>novelas de costumbres</em> also aspired to represent
                           the local world and society in all its facets, but with a different
                           motivation than the realist novels in the proper sense. Furthermore,
                           especially Cuban novels are marked by a realistic orientation from early on
                           and persistently in the nineteenth century because many authors were
                           concerned with the social ills caused by the system of slavery. In terms of
                           literary currents, this leads to works that mix romantic and realist(ic)
                           elements, for instance, the novel “Francisco” (1839/1880) by Anselmo Suárez

                           later realist and naturalistic novels has led Molina to consider some
                           nineteenth-century novels as instances of Naturalism before its time. Her

                           first half of the nineteenth century is expected to complicate the textual
                           separation of romantic and realist novels. On the other hand, the
                           simultaneity of romantic, realist, and naturalistic works in Spanish America
                           after 1880 and the existence of novels that included elements of several
                           currents at once is another factor that could render the classification of
                           the works by literary current more difficult.<sup id="ftn110" class="w3-btn w3-theme-l3 w3-circle" onclick="document.getElementById('ftn110-modal').style.display='block'">110</sup> However, the assumption can also be made
                           that there are prototypical cores of romantic, realist, and naturalistic
                           novels in the sense of distinctive genres following aesthetic models that
                           primarily have a European origin. In the case of the realist novel, elements
                           that could lead to a coherent text type are specific topics such as life in
                           the city, business and economic speculation, and the portrayal of different
                           social classes. On a stylistic level, the hypothesis can be formulated that
                           there are many and long descriptive passages and dialogues which have
                           specific linguistic characteristics, for example, regarding the use of many
                           different adjectives and nouns. These could contribute to the identification
                           of a realist text type. A second hypothesis is that besides a realist text
                           type in the narrow sense, another text type could become visible, in which
                           realist and romantic elements are combined and in which the many novels that
                           have conventionally been described as mixtures of romantic and realist(ic)
                           elements take part.</p>

                           also the naturalistic ones started from a foreign model that was
                           successively adapted to the particular needs of expression in Argentina,
                           Cuba, and Mexico. In the case of the naturalistic novel, the model was
                           primarily supplied by the French author Émile Zola, who propagated a
                           scientific conception of man and a biological and medical way of thinking.
                           In the naturalistic novel, realist techniques were carried forward to
                           utilize the literary work as a means of experimentation and and for case
                           studies of milieu, anthropology, genetics, or pathologies (<span class="w3-tooltip w3-border-bottom w3-border-blue-grey">Dill 1999, 168–169<span class="w3-text w3-tag w3-round w3-blue-grey w3-left-align w3-padding w3-large" style="position:absolute;left:0;bottom:25px">Dill, Hans-Otto. 1999. <em>Geschichte der

                           to the realist novel, the importance of the author’s creativity for
                           producing an effect of reality is replaced by the aspiration for a pure
                           documentary style. Nature shall be discovered “as is”. The development of
                           the characters is a logical one, and inner reactions are subjected to
                           mechanical processes. Reality is shown in its raw form, and no moral limits
                           are set to the kinds of environment or human abysses that are studied. The
                           goal is to stimulate the readers’ reflection by reproducing things as they

                           the realist novel tends to be reduced, and the focus is on the protagonists
                           whose psychological development is examined. The characters expose
                           themselves through their way of speaking, either in dialogue or indirect
                           speech, showing the regional or social determination of their means of

                           published in several different countries and in all of the three countries
                           that are the focus here. The first and most naturalistic novels appeared in

                           because of the ambition to depict reality closely, and the different
                           literary currents concurred temporally in the last decades of the nineteenth
                           century. There are, however, some elements of naturalistic novels on the
                           basis of which it can be hypothesized that they are distinguishable as
                           textual genres. The crude style, usage of scientific or other specialized
                           vocabularies, and the specific topics of this type of novel, such as the
                           topics of immigration, mental and physical problems, and processes of social
                           disintegration, are expected to facilitate their classification against
                           realist and especially romantic novels. It is assumed that the novels that
                           are conventionally labeled as naturalistic ones are also textually coherent
                           to a relatively high degree. However, a difficulty might arise from the
                           confusion and flexibility of the terms “realist” and “naturalistic” in the
                           corresponding literary critical discourse and thus from the conventional
                           class labels. If these terms are used with an overlapping or even identical
                           scope, they are no longer a sign for different subgenres.<sup id="ftn112" class="w3-btn w3-theme-l3 w3-circle" onclick="document.getElementById('ftn112-modal').style.display='block'">112</sup></p>

                     example of the work “La folie du jour”, written by Maurice Blanchot, Derrida
                     shows how literary texts resist their categorization in terms of genre: “The
                     genre has always in all genres been able to play the role of order’s
                     principle: resemblance, analogy, identity and difference, taxonomic
                     classification, organization and genealogical tree, order of reason, order
                     of reasons, sense of sense, truth of truth, natural light and sense of
                     history. Now, the test of <em>An Account</em>? brought to light the
                     madness of genre. Madness has given birth to and thrown light on the genre
                     in the most dazzling, most blinding sense of the word. And in the writing of
                     <em>An Account</em>?, in literature, satirically practicing all
                     genres, imbibing them but never allowing herself to be saturated with a
                     catalog of genres, she, madness, has started spinning Peterson’s genre-disc
                     like a demented sun. And she does not only do so <em>in</em> literature,
                     for in concealing the boundaries that sunder mode and genre, she has also
                     inundated and divided the borders between literature and its others” (<span class="w3-tooltip w3-border-bottom w3-border-blue-grey">Derrida 1980, 81<span class="w3-text w3-tag w3-round w3-blue-grey w3-left-align w3-padding w3-large" style="position:absolute;left:0;bottom:25px">Derrida, Jacques. 1980. “The Law of Genre.” Translated by

                     characteristic: “Genauso wie man ‘Kopf’, ‘Apfel’, ‘Platz’, ‘Tisch’ u.ä.

                     discussing the problems of differentiating between theoretical and
                     historical genres, notes that an infinite number of traits can be chosen
                     to compare texts: “En second lieu, et inversement, le nombre de
                     caractéristiques selon lesquelles on peut regrouper deux textes
                     quelconques est indéfini sinon infini. Cela est dû au fait que, lorsqu’on
                     compare deux textes, on ne part pas de leur <em>identité
                        numérique</em> (toujours simple), mais de ce que Luis J. Prieto
                     appelle leur <em>identité spécifique</em> (défini comme un ensemble
                     de caractéristiques non contradictoires). Or, «comme chaque objet possède
                     un nombre infini de caractéristiques, il peut posséder un nombre infini
                     d’identités spécifiques; et comme n’importe quelle caractéristique que
                     présente un objet donné peut toujours aussi faire partie des
                     caractéristiques d’un autre objet, chaque objet peut partager n’importe
                     laquelle de ses identités spécifiques avec un nombre infini d’autres

                     developments in literary genres: “We collect 2113 books from Project

                     namely adventure (585 books), romance (383 books), mystery (380 books),

Schöch analyses
                     subgenres of French Classical and Enlightenment Drama by applying topic
                     modeling to a corpus of plays that was initially curated by Paul Fièvre
                     (called the “Théâtre classique” collection). The data which is used in
                     the analysis is presented in detail, and the subgenres are also
                     mentioned, but it is not made explicit where the labels that are finally
                     used come from: “detailed metadata has been added to the texts relating,
                     for instance, to their historical genre label (e.g. <em>comédie
                        héroique</em>, <em>tragédie</em>, or <em>opéra-ballet</em>)
                     as well as the type of thematic and regional inspiration [...]. A large
                     part of this information can fruitfully be used when applying Topic
                     Modeling to this text collection. [...] Finally, all the plays included
                     belong to one of the following subgenres: comedy, tragedy or tragicomedy”

                     Looking into the TEI collection on GitHub (e.g., <a href="https://github.com/cligs/theatreclassique/blob/master/tei/tc0001.xml">https://github.com/cligs/theatreclassique/blob/master/tei/tc0001.xml</a>,
                     accessed November 28, 2020), it can be noticed that there is a general
                     subgenre assignment in the TEI header (<code><span style="color: #000096;">&lt;term</span> <span style="color: #f5844c">type=</span><span style="color: #993300;">"genre"</span><span style="color: #000096;">&gt;</span>Comédie<span style="color: #000096;">&lt;/term&gt;</span></code>), but no further information about its
                     provenience is given. As Schöch mentions the historical subgenre labels
                     in his text, it can be assumed that these are the source. The
                     classification of works into dramatic subgenres is probably less debated
                     than into subgenres of the novel. Likely, dramatic subgenre labels are
                     also more often explicitly given on title pages than in the case of
                     novels. Still, it would be better to make the generic convention that is
                     analyzed more explicit because it makes a difference whether labels
                     assigned by librarians or literary historians or genre labels from the
                     historical paratexts of the works are used.</div>

                     analyzed a corpus of 9,000 dime novels in German language, which were
                     published between 2009 and 2017. They aimed to find out how the subgenres
                     of the dime novels can be differentiated and in what way the corpus as a
                     whole is different from high-prestige novels. They used the 8,000 most
                     frequent nouns as features and classified the novels with Logistic
                     Regression. In addition, a clustering was done on the basis of the 2,000
                     MFW. To analyze the relevant features for the different subgenres, topic
                     modeling and a contrastive analysis with the Zeta measure were performed.
                     They found that the subgenres can be distinguished well both on a
                     stylistic and a thematic level. Regarding the complexity of dime novels
                     compared to high-prestige literature, they found that sentences are
                     shorter in dime novels. However, they did not find any clear differences

                     anchoring is Voßkamp’s concept of genres as institutions, which are
                     determined by their social and functional history. Voßkamp understands
                     genres as selections among several possible alternatives and argues that
                     prototypical works play an important role in institutionalizing generic
                     conventions and forming generic norms. According to the institutional theory
                     of genres, an important task is to analyze the literary- and
                     socio-historical context and the conditions of the prototypical works’
                     creation, to understand what differentiates them from the alternatives that

                     “The approach to the study of literature that I am calling ‘macroanalysis’
                     is in some general ways akin to economics or, more specifically, to
                     macroeconomics. [...] There was, however, ‘microeconomics,’ which studies
                     the economic behavior of individual consumers and individual businesses. As
                     such, microeconomics can be seen as analogous to our study of individual
                     texts via ‘close readings.’ Macroeconomics, however, is about the study of
                     the entire economy. It tends towards enumeration and quantification and is
                     in this sense similar to bibliographic studies, biographical studies,
                     literary history, philology, and the enumerative, quantitative analysis of
                     text that is the foundation of computing in the humanities” (<span class="w3-tooltip w3-border-bottom w3-border-blue-grey">Jockers 2013, 24<span class="w3-text w3-tag w3-round w3-blue-grey w3-left-align w3-padding w3-large" style="position:absolute;left:0;bottom:25px">Jockers, Matthew L. 2013. <em>Macroanalysis.

                     listing the opportunities of the macroanalytic approach, Jockers mentions
                     several points that are linked to historical contextualization and change:
                     “This approach offers specific insights into literary-historical questions,
                     including insights into: the historical place of individual texts, authors,
                     and genres in relation to a larger literary context; literary production in
                     terms of growth and decline over time or within regions or within
                     demographic groups; literary patterns and lexicons employed over time,
                     across periods, within regions, or within demographic groups; the cultural
                     and societal forces that impact literary style and the evolution of style;
                     the cultural, historical, and societal linkages that bind or do not bind
                     individual authors, texts, and genres into an aggregate literary culture;
                     the waxing and waning of literary themes; the tastes and preferences of the
                     literary establishment and whether those preferences correspond to general

                     full texts, and he repeatedly points out how they develop historically. For
                     example, he trains models for specific decades and analyzes which texts from

                     Rigorous poetics of the novella existed, but these were not consistent
                     with the texts called novellas. Furthermore, the texts carrying the label
                     “novella” could not be described as a homogeneous group (<span class="w3-tooltip w3-border-bottom w3-border-blue-grey">Schröter 2019, 229<span class="w3-text w3-tag w3-round w3-blue-grey w3-left-align w3-padding w3-large" style="position:absolute;left:0;bottom:25px">Schröter, Julian. 2019. “Gattungsgeschichte und ihr

                     Schröter proposes to define “intersections” between the texts referred to
                     as novellas and classificatory sets of texts so that, for example, texts
                     with the name novella that were published as fictional journal prose and
                     share the characteristics of the latter type of text would form one
                     subtype of the genre novella. Schröter states: “It is important not to
                     summarily define such intersections as novellas, as is often done. Such a
                     definition would result in a classificatory concept of the respective
                     genre, which in turn would no longer be suitable for comprehending the
                     historical use of the generic label and hence the semantics of a genre in
                     literary-historical communication.” (<span class="w3-tooltip w3-border-bottom w3-border-blue-grey">Schröter 2019, 228<span class="w3-text w3-tag w3-round w3-blue-grey w3-left-align w3-padding w3-large" style="position:absolute;left:0;bottom:25px">Schröter, Julian. 2019. “Gattungsgeschichte und ihr

                     terminology proposed here, the intersection of texts referred to as
                     novellas and fictional journal prose would be called a “textual literary
                     genre”, whereas the semantics of the novella in literary-historical
                     communication would be referred to as the “conventional literary genre”.
                     The novella, as a conventional literary genre, would then consist of

                     analyzing the prototypicality of individual texts with regard to genres
                     is pursued by Konle in his master thesis about word embeddings for
                     literary texts. Using 200-word segments of novels, Konle trained a neural
                     network aiming to find words that are distinctive for different genres.
                     The network is trained for the subgenres of sentimental, crime,
                     science-fiction, and horror novels and is used to classify the segments
                     by genre. When discussing the results, Konle analyses individual segments
                     that were misclassified. He finds out that there are cases in which the
                     misclassifications make sense because the novels are not prototypical for
                     their genres in all parts and contain passages with words that are
                     distinctive for other genres. These can be elements of the plot that are
                     interpreted in terms of another subgenre, for example, passages about the
                     death of characters in sentimental novels that are classified as horror

                     critique was formulated by Vivas already in 1968. Vivas discusses several
                     aesthetic, social, and philosophical reasons for the unpopularity of the
                     idea of genres as classes. He criticizes the family resemblance notion as
                     a loophole to avoid the question of the genre’s nominalistic or realistic
                     status: “Taken seriously, nominalism involves the notion that structures
                     have no status in being whatever. But how a totally invertebrate world is
                     possible I have never been able to understand. ‘There is,’ you may say,
                     ‘a new solution to this old problem.’ ‘Yes, I know,’ I reply, ‘there is a
                     newfangled one: It is the evangel of Saint Ludwig.’ According to these
                     glad tidings the members of a class share among themselves, not
                     identities but family resemblances. Obviously I cannot stop to analyze

                     reduction that projects the data points onto so-called “principal

                     only considering the resulting principal components further. In digital

                     the PCA analysis under the heading “Clustering”, as does Oakes in his
                     general introduction to statistics for corpus linguistics, because the
                     data is grouped based on similarity (or distance) relationships. Oakes
                     also uses the term “categorization” for clustering methods (<span class="w3-tooltip w3-border-bottom w3-border-blue-grey">Oakes 2003, 95<span class="w3-text w3-tag w3-round w3-blue-grey w3-left-align w3-padding w3-large" style="position:absolute;left:0;bottom:25px">Oakes, Michael P. 2003. <em>Statistics for corpus

                     clustering and classification are considered categorization methods (in

                  <div class="w3-container w3-padding-large">The field of “literary”
                     features is understood here as including aspects of the texts that are
                     constitutive, typical, or relevant for them according to literary theory.
                     Usually, the linguistic level is an intermediary between the literary features
                     and their formal expression on the textual surface. Literary features are thus
                     more difficult to formalize than linguistic features because their expression
                     in linguistic surface features is not necessarily straightforward. Regarding
                     the question of what constitutes a literary and what a linguistic feature,
                     there is, of course, some area of overlap. Rhetorical figures, for example, can
                     be conceived as elements characteristic of literary style, but their definition
                     is often directly based on linguistic concepts. For genre analyses,
                     specifically literary features are relevant because in definitions of literary
                     genres, usually literary concepts are used and not linguistic ones. So if the
                     results of digital genre stylistics should be linked to literary theoretical
                     discussions of genre, the question of how to formalize literary features and
                     how to link them to surface text style is a prerequisite.</div>

                     1940, structures the chapter on the novel of the romantic period into
                     subchapters on the historical and the political, the indianist, and the
                     sentimental novel. She dedicates another subchapter to the novel of the
                     transition to realism. That chapter includes parts on the historical,
                     social and <em>costumbrista</em> novel, the latter including the
                     <em>gaucho</em>, <em>indio</em>, and antislavery novel. As she
                     is concentrating on the novel alone, Gálvez’s account is more
                     differentiated than the one of Dill. She takes up several subgenres again
                     in the chapters on the later realist, modernist, and regionalist
                     currents, for example, the historical novel and the novel of customs,
                     showing that they did not cease to exist, but continued to be practiced
                     under the influence of different literary currents (<span class="w3-tooltip w3-border-bottom w3-border-blue-grey">Gálvez 1990<span class="w3-text w3-tag w3-round w3-blue-grey w3-left-align w3-padding w3-large" style="position:absolute;left:0;bottom:25px">Gálvez, Marina. 1990. <em>La novela hispanoamericana

                     currents did not produce the same range of new, own, distinguishable, and
                     widely recognized thematic subgenres as the romantic current
