               <p id="p767"><span class="paracount w3-blue-grey w3-margin-right"><a href="#p767">767</a></span>A central question raised in the introduction was how literary genres
                  can be conceived in theoretical terms as categories that can capture the common
                  aspects that humans see in literary works of the same genres. Moreover, the
                  theoretical conception of literary genres should be able to grasp the common features
                  of literary works belonging to a genre on a textual level. In the context of
                  computational literary studies, this applies not only to the analysis of textual
                  properties of genres by literary scholars but also by computers. To that end,
                  concepts of genre stemming from literary theory were discussed in the theoretical
                  part of this dissertation and were related to the aims and procedures of digital
                  genre stylistics.</p>
               
               <p id="p768"><span class="paracount w3-blue-grey w3-margin-right"><a href="#p768">768</a></span>Regarding the ontological status of genres, it was argued that they can
                  best be understood as communicative norms or conventions which have an influence on
                  the stylistic form of the literary texts that participate in them. Surface cues of
                  the texts that are related to genre labels can be interpreted as traces or “normative
                  facts”, in the terms of Hempfer (<span class="w3-tooltip w3-border-bottom w3-border-blue-grey">1973<span class="w3-text w3-tag w3-round w3-blue-grey w3-left-align w3-padding w3-large" style="position:absolute;left:0;bottom:25px">Hempfer, Klaus W. 1973. <em>Gattungstheorie.
                           Information und Synthese.</em> München: Fink.</span></span>), which are left by the genre conventions. In this way, even a digital
                  stylistic text analysis can capture elements of communicative phenomena that are,
                  at
                  least to a certain degree, determined by factors that lie outside of the syntactic
                  and semantic level of literary texts.</p>
               
               <p id="p769"><span class="paracount w3-blue-grey w3-margin-right"><a href="#p769">769</a></span>As a second aspect of the theoretical part of this dissertation, the
                  usefulness of semiotic models of genres for the modeling of generic terms was
                  highlighted. They allow to organize conventional signals that are transported by
                  genre labels on different linguistic and contextual levels so that stylistic analyses
                  can focus on selected semiotic levels. Semiotic levels include the thematic one,
                  which is, for instance, primarily addressed by sentimental or social novels, or the
                  level concerned with the relationship of the texts to reality, for which historical,
                  science fiction, or fantastic novels are examples. These are only two of the possible
                  semiotic levels to which generic names can refer. Most of the genre labels do not
                  refer to one level exclusively, but it is helpful to decide on a specific dimension
                  of genre discourse that is examined, to compare genres or subgenres on a similar
                  level. To make decisions for selected levels of analysis is especially relevant for
                  digital genre stylistics because corpus studies are usually performed in a
                  contrastive setting, either by comparing one subgenre to a larger corpus covering
                  a
                  superordinate major genre or by opposing individual genres or subgenres directly.
                  Analyzing the discursive levels that genre labels refer to can also provide useful
                  hints about the textual traits that could be relevant for them and can lead to
                  hypotheses about the stylistic characteristics of the texts participating in the
                  genre in question. For thematic subgenres, for instance, topic features can be a good
                  choice. However, it must be assumed that most genres are defined on several textual
                  levels at once. In any case, in digital stylistic analysis, the textual traits must
                  all be captured on the textual surface, and they must therefore be formalized and
                  leveled down to text style, as is done by using topics as indicators for thematic
                  developments. As a result, other aspects of text surface style may enter the feature
                  space. In the case of topics, for example, not only thematic elements become visible
                  but also aspects of the setting, plot, or specific literary motifs. This shows that
                  a
                  connection between genre conventions, textual traits of genres, and surface style
                  can
                  be assumed and deduced, or induced, but that this connection is a complex one, which
                  still needs to be investigated further in theoretical and empirical terms.</p>
               
               <p id="p770"><span class="paracount w3-blue-grey w3-margin-right"><a href="#p770">770</a></span>A third finding of the theoretical part was that for digital genre
                  stylistics, it is advantageous to have separate concepts of literary text types,
                  conventional genres, and textual genres. In this way, not only theoretically driven
                  genre analyses, starting from certain concepts of textual genres are enabled, but
                  also exploratory ones concerned with groupings of texts that emerge from stylistic
                  features. This is important because it is not necessarily directly possible to
                  clarify the relationship between literary definitions of genres and surface style
                  captured in computational analyses. Theoretically, such a relationship is most often
                  hypothesis-driven, and practically, many tools that formalize literary concepts are
                  still missing. In literary genre theory, there are proposals of how to distinguish
                  text types from genres, but they usually adhere to a relationship of dependence
                  between both. Here it was proposed to completely separate the levels of literary text
                  types and literary conventional genres to be able to define and find intersections
                  of
                  both as a result.</p>
               
               <p id="p771"><span class="paracount w3-blue-grey w3-margin-right"><a href="#p771">771</a></span>In the part on the different literary theoretical concepts of genres as
                  categories (classes, prototypes, and families), it was laid out how they can be
                  applied fruitfully by using statistical categorization methods. Classification,
                  clustering, or network analysis constitute different options to analyze literary text
                  types and to relate them to conventional genres. It was argued that there is no
                  exclusive relationship between each of these text categorization methods and the
                  different literary theoretical concepts of genre categories. Instead, each method
                  covers different aspects of several types of categories. Statistical classification,
                  for instance, can also be used to determine the prototypicality of literary texts
                  as
                  instances of genres to a certain degree. On the other hand, networks can not only
                  be
                  used for family resemblance analyses, but also allow the formation of clusters in
                  the
                  networks, which then represent delimited groups.</p>
               
               <p id="p772"><span class="paracount w3-blue-grey w3-margin-right"><a href="#p772">772</a></span>In the chapter on style, a definition of literary genre style was
                  formulated that applies the concept of style formulated by Herrmann, Schöch, and van
                  Dalen-Oskam (<span class="w3-tooltip w3-border-bottom w3-border-blue-grey">2015<span class="w3-text w3-tag w3-round w3-blue-grey w3-left-align w3-padding w3-large" style="position:absolute;left:0;bottom:25px">Herrmann, J. Berenike, Christof Schöch, and Karina

                  field of literary genre analysis. In this definition, the distinction between
                  communicatively determined, conventional genres and formally determined literary text
                  types is included. Furthermore, a distinction is made between higher-level stylistic
                  traits and low-level surface cues, and it is formulated which types of linguistic
                  features are considered stylistic cues. In this way, the relationships between
                  literary genres and their stylistic characteristics on the one hand and linguistic
                  features of the surface of texts on the other hand is differentiated and made
                  clear.</p>
               
               <p id="p773"><span class="paracount w3-blue-grey w3-margin-right"><a href="#p773">773</a></span>In the last part of the Concepts chapter, selected thematic subgenres
                  and literary currents of the nineteenth-century Spanish-American novel were presented
                  with a view to genre-stylistic characteristics. In this way, the textual analysis
                  of
                  these subgenres conducted in the Analysis chapter of the dissertation was prepared
                  and related to established literary-historical knowledge.</p>
               
               <p id="p774"><span class="paracount w3-blue-grey w3-margin-right"><a href="#p774">774</a></span>The various considerations of the theory section contribute to relating
                  established theoretical concepts of literary and linguistic studies to computer-based
                  analyses of literary genres. On the one hand, this should promote a theoretical
                  foundation of textual analyses of digital genre stylistics. On the other hand, it
                  should also be possible to relate the results obtained with digital genre stylistic
                  analyses to previous results obtained with classical methods. They should not be
                  detached from previous research in literary history, but should enter, be, and remain
                  in dialogue with it. Recent developments in the digital humanities show that the need
                  for a stronger theoretical foundation is seen. For example, a working group on
                  digital humanities theory has been established in the DHd association (<span class="w3-tooltip w3-border-bottom w3-border-blue-grey">AG Digital Humanities Theorie

In relation to the results of this dissertation, the next step will be
                  to see to what extent the suggestions made here for concepts of digital genre
                  stylistics can be useful not only for the analyses in this specific thesis, but also
                  in other application studies. Furthermore, the conceptual considerations of genre
                  categories and computational categorization can still be extended and need to be
                  supported by further empirical studies.</p>
               
               <p id="p775"><span class="paracount w3-blue-grey w3-margin-right"><a href="#p775">775</a></span>In the empirical part of this thesis, the methodology for the creation
                  of a digital bibliography serving as a sampling frame and a text corpus aimed at the
                  analysis of nineteenth-century Spanish-American novels with regard to subgenres was
                  discussed and presented in detail. The approaches taken were outlined in practical
                  terms and by example, addressing the specific questions, challenges, and solutions
                  found for the bibliography and corpus at hand. Still, the proceedings followed were
                  also the result of general considerations and discussions in the CLiGS project. They
                  can be taken as a proposal for how to prepare a digital corpus of literary texts for
                  genre analysis in a good way. The findings of these reflections in the project led
                  to
                  the creation of the “textbox” as an exemplary set of text collections for digital
                  literary analysis (<span class="w3-tooltip w3-border-bottom w3-border-blue-grey">Schöch et al.

                  implementation of data modeling in the digital bibliography on novels, their
                  subgenres, and the editions in which they were published is also of a general
                  character and it goes beyond what was worked out on text corpora in the project
                  group. Own decisions have also been made for the digital text corpus regarding its
                  composition and the modeling of the metadata and text structure. These have mainly
                  resulted from the subject matter of the nineteenth-century Spanish-American
                  novels.</p>
               
               <p id="p776"><span class="paracount w3-blue-grey w3-margin-right"><a href="#p776">776</a></span>One question was, for example, how to define the limits of the corpus
                  in generic terms – how to determine if a literary work can be considered a novel in
                  several hundreds of cases without being able to read every single work? Here, the
                  decision was to start from a very general formal definition of the novel and to check
                  the fulfillment of its requirements in part through quantitative analysis and in part
                  by evaluating available metadata and by checking the information in paratexts
                  manually. The selection of subgenres, on the other hand, was not predetermined, so
                  that the bibliography Bib-ACMé and the corpus Conha19 constitute general resources
                  covering the Spanish-American nineteenth-century novel as it is represented by works
                  from the three countries Argentina, Cuba, and Mexico. It is hoped that this corpus
                  will be used in the future by other researchers for digital text analysis, which may
                  also have a different focus than that pursued here. For example, the corpus could
                  also be used for the study of authorship, for an analysis that examines chronological
                  developments within the nineteenth century, or for the analysis of specific motifs
                  or
                  themes in the texts. Individual texts from Conha19 encoded in TEI could also serve
                  as
                  a starting point for the development of digital critical editions of selected works.
                  Finally, a desirable future development is to add novels from other Spanish-American
                  countries to the corpus, or texts from other major genres (for example, drama), in
                  order to make cross-genre analyses possible.</p>
               
               <p id="p777"><span class="paracount w3-blue-grey w3-margin-right"><a href="#p777">777</a></span>As the analysis of subgenres was the goal of this thesis, a particular
                  focus in the corpus-building process was on the information about the subgenres of
                  the novels, which was collected by evaluating different literary-historical sources
                  and explicit and implicit historical genre labels and signals. All of this material
                  represents the conventional level of the novels’ subgenres. It was organized by
                  encoding it in TEI according to an empirically induced model of discursive levels
                  of
                  subgenres, including the following levels: 
                  <ul>
                     
                     <li>thematic subgenre labels</li>
                     
                     <li>labels referring to literary currents</li>
                     
                     <li>labels related to the cultural-geographical and linguistic identity</li>
                     
                     <li>labels pointing to the relationship between the novel and reality</li>
                     
                     <li>labels concerned with the mode that a novel is narrated in</li>

                     <li>labels that refer to the medium that a novel uses and the mode that it is
                        represented in linguistically or narratively</li>
                     </ul> An interesting question is whether other extensive empirical studies of genre
                  signals and genre assignments will arrive at similar categorizations, i.e., whether
                  a
                  general trend of the types of genre signals and, in particular, their frequencies
                  can
                  be identified, or whether the results obtained here are specific to Spanish-American
                  novels. Only further corpus-based studies of historical and literary critical genre
                  assignments will be able to show this.</p>

                  in literary critical and also explicit historical subgenre labels but that only a
                  few
                  of them are quantitatively relevant. The frequent ones were found in particular on
                  the thematic level (“novela histórica”, “novela de costumbres”, “novela sentimental”,
                  etc.) and the contextual levels of literary current (“novela romántica”, “novela
                  realista”, “novela naturalista”, and so on) as well as of the cultural, geographical,
                  or linguistic identity (as expressed through the labels “novela argentina”, “novela
                  mexicana”, “novela cubana”, or “novela original”). For the text analysis part, it
                  was
                  decided to focus on the thematic subgenres and the literary currents. Labels related
                  to the cultural, geographical, or linguistic identity have been evaluated in a
                  research article outside of the scope of this dissertation (<span class="w3-tooltip w3-border-bottom w3-border-blue-grey">Henny-Krahmer 2022<span class="w3-text w3-tag w3-round w3-blue-grey w3-left-align w3-padding w3-large" style="position:absolute;left:0;bottom:25px">Henny-Krahmer, Ulrike. 2022. “Novelas originales y

                  of genre labels were effectively evaluated in this thesis. The great variety of
                  subgenre labels found for the novels in Bib-ACMé and Conha19 shows how multifaceted
                  the novel as a genre is and further analyses that can proceed from the material
                  encoded here are possible. As a result, quantitative digital text analysis is only
                  one of several possible approaches for analyzing the subgenres of the
                  nineteenth-century Spanish-American novel. The big pool of different subgenres and
                  generic terms that are not so frequent can only meaningfully be analyzed
                  qualitatively.</p>
               
               <p id="p779"><span class="paracount w3-blue-grey w3-margin-right"><a href="#p779">779</a></span>Besides assessing different levels and perspectives on subgenres of the
                  novels, the metadata analysis also served to check how well the corpus represents
                  the
                  material collected in the more extensive bibliography in quantitative terms. The
                  relationship between both resources was found to be approximately proportional in
                  most but not all aspects. For example, the corpus contains more works written by
                  well-known, high-prestige authors than the bibliography. This is not surprising
                  because these are the works that have primarily been digitized. Still, this aspect
                  of
                  the corpus can still be improved. It is desirable to enlarge the corpus in the future
                  and include even more works of lesser-known authors than the ones it already
                  contains. That would make the corpus more representative of the whole production of
                  Argentine, Cuban, and Mexican nineteenth-century novels. As the corpus is published
                  with this dissertation, it can be hoped that it provides a starting point for
                  building a more extensive collection of nineteenth-century Spanish-American
                  novels.</p>
               
               <p id="p780"><span class="paracount w3-blue-grey w3-margin-right"><a href="#p780">780</a></span>In the text analysis part, statistical classification was used as the
                  first method for categorizing the novels by their subgenre. To this end, one primary
                  subgenre label was determined for each novel, and the classification was done for
                  thematic subgenres and literary currents. Both subgenres and currents can be
                  classified well on the basis of most frequent words and topic features. Experiments
                  with three types of classifiers (K-nearest neighbor, Support Vector Machine, and
                  Random Forest) and several different feature sets were run. In the case of MFW,
                  different token units, numbers of words, and normalization techniques were used. For
                  topics, different numbers of topics and optimization parameters for the modeling were
                  chosen. The results showed that both subgenres and currents are textually coherent
                  to
                  degrees of 70 to 90&nbsp;%, depending on the type of features and subgenre. Textual
                  coherence here refers to the degree to which the communicatively determined subgenre
                  assignments of the novels coincide with their class assignments as determined by text
                  classification, measured in classification accuracy.</p>
               
               <p id="p781"><span class="paracount w3-blue-grey w3-margin-right"><a href="#p781">781</a></span>In general, the differences between the two feature types were minor.
                  In the case of thematic subgenres, there was almost no difference in the accuracy
                  values between most frequent words and topics, and for literary currents, most
                  frequent words worked a bit better than topics.</p>
               
               <p id="p782"><span class="paracount w3-blue-grey w3-margin-right"><a href="#p782">782</a></span>The classification results for the literary currents were better than
                  for the thematic subgenres. This was not expected from the beginning because the
                  currents are broader phenomena which, at least in the case of the realist and
                  romantic novels, include several thematic subgenres. While the realist and
                  naturalistic novels were mainly published in the last two decades of the nineteenth
                  century and the first decade of the twentieth century, the romantic novel was present
                  from the early decades of the nineteenth century up to the last ones, with a dominant
                  role up to the 1870s. So also diachronically, especially the romantic novels
                  constitute a general phenomenon. The classification results suggest that the literary
                  currents nonetheless represent a level of the novels that can be captured better
                  stylistically than the thematic subgenres.</p>
               
               <p id="p783"><span class="paracount w3-blue-grey w3-margin-right"><a href="#p783">783</a></span>That literary currents can be better recognized stylistically than
                  thematic subgenres was also visible in the visualizations of the amount of correct
                  and wrong classifications for individual novels of the corpus. For the thematic
                  subgenres, there were cases of regular false positives and false negatives, that is,
                  novels that carry the respective genre label but were classified as another subgenre
                  in more than 70&nbsp;% of the cases or novels that do not carry the label but were
                  recognized as members of the subgenre almost in every case. Such instances of novels
                  were not present in the results for the literary currents. The same could be observed
                  for the “middle range” of novels that are misclassified in around 30 to 70&nbsp;% of the
                  cases, which happened for the thematic subgenres but not for the literary currents.
                  This concludes that the levels of genre convention and text type are more congruent
                  for the literary currents than for the thematic subgenres. When evaluating these
                  results, it has to be kept in mind that the labels for literary currents were mainly
                  collected from literary-historical sources. In contrast, the thematic labels are also
                  present as explicit historical labels on the texts, so it is more probable that there
                  are discrepancies between convention and text type than for critically established
                  labels. Nevertheless, it may as well be the case that there is less consensus on the
                  major theme of novels than on their dominant style in terms of literary currents.</p>
               
               <p id="p784"><span class="paracount w3-blue-grey w3-margin-right"><a href="#p784">784</a></span>The text classification in the context of this dissertation has not yet
                  taken into account the multiple subgenre assignments recorded in Bib-ACMé and
                  Conha19. For the purposes of this thesis, the most plausible primary subgenre label
                  was selected as the classification target in order to establish a classification
                  baseline in a classical setting in the first place. This has not been done before
                  for
                  Spanish-American novels. The next obvious step is applying multi-label classification
                  procedures to include secondary and further subgenre assignments. Especially in the
                  case of thematic subgenres, there are very often multiple classifications on a
                  communicative level. These occur in the historical subtitles of the novels (e.g.,
                  “novela histórica de costumbres”) and especially when literary scholars describe the
                  novels in terms of thematic subgenres. It can therefore be assumed that such multiple
                  attributions are also textually and stylistically relevant. Another way to further
                  map the complexity of the novels in terms of their subgenres would be to include
                  chapter structures or to divide the novels into text sections to classify them
                  individually. The corpus Conha19 is well prepared for both approaches.</p>
               
               <p id="p785"><span class="paracount w3-blue-grey w3-margin-right"><a href="#p785">785</a></span>As an alternative approach to text categorization, a family resemblance
                  network analysis was conducted, with a focus on the internal structure of individual
                  subgenres and a focus on the historical novel. It showed that specific subtypes of
                  historical novels are obscured in the classification approach because they do not
                  represent the quantitatively dominant type of romantic historical novels. However,
                  these subtypes of historical novels become visible as a family when the corpus of
                  historical novels is partitioned into network communities based on individual
                  similarity relationships between the texts. When two subgenres were combined in the
                  network, it became clear that several factors other than genre influence the style
                  of
                  the novels, for instance, the period of publication or the narrative perspective.
                  These results show that statistical classification is a powerful method that yields
                  very good results but also occludes interior subdivisions and stylistic differences
                  of the novels that are part of the subgenres, so for exploratory and refining
                  analyses, a family resemblance network analysis is a good alternative.</p>
               
               <p id="p786"><span class="paracount w3-blue-grey w3-margin-right"><a href="#p786">786</a></span>Returning to the observation made at the outset that categorization is
                  a basic human need, the analyses here have shown that human assignments of texts to
                  genres, in terms of communicative phenomena, function differently from
                  computer-assisted stylistic genre classification. The classifiers are powerful tools
                  that can recognize which subgenres the novels belong to in most cases. However, they
                  do not (yet) understand how the text style is related to the perceived conventional
                  genre of the texts. This led to errors and unexpected results in some individual
                  cases. The classifiers are more strict in interpreting the textual surface
                  structures. Because they are different in that way from a human author or reader,
                  through the analysis of mistakes that the statistical models make, they bring the
                  opportunity to understand better how genres function as communicative phenomena. This
                  understanding is supported by alternative categorization methods, such as the family
                  resemblance approach presented in this thesis. Research in digital genre stylistics
                  and computational literary studies needs to continue to engage with literary theory,
                  literary history, and computational approaches to develop their own suitable methods
                  for their objects of study.</p>
               
               <p id="p787"><span class="paracount w3-blue-grey w3-margin-right"><a href="#p787">787</a></span>In the future, the text analysis can be developed further by using
                  other features, especially those that can be related more directly to literary
                  concepts, such as character constellations or literary space. In many cases, however,
                  the computational caption of such features on the textual surface has yet to be
                  developed. Another enhancement for the analysis would be not to analyze the novels
                  as
                  a whole, as was done here, but to evaluate the results for text segments, chapters,
                  or different parts of the narration, such as direct speech versus narrator text. The
                  textual characteristics of genres may also be defined in connection to these
                  substructures of the texts and not only for the entire texts. Furthermore,
                  classification and network analysis are just two of the further available options
                  of
                  computational text categorization methods that could be employed for genre analysis.
                  Especially the concept of genres as prototypical structures could be approached with
                  clustering methods, for example, which has not been done in the scope of this
                  dissertation. Moreover, of course, there should be more empirical studies based on
                  other literatures and corpora in order to be able to identify broader trends in the
                  history of genres and to be able to come to more general conclusions than was
                  possible in this work on the nineteenth-century Spanish-American novel. Thus, future
                  research directions in digital genre stylistics could be envisioned here but have
                  yet
                  to be carried out. Hopefully, the spirit of Open Science will be followed in future
                  genre-stylistic research, as it has been done in this work, by making the texts,
                  data, and scripts all openly available, as far as legally possible.</p>
