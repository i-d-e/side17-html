  <span style="color: #000096;">&lt;p</span><span style="color: #000096;">&gt;</span>The source PDF file was processed with OCR. The software used
  was ABBYY Finereader 12 Professional, with Spanish as
  recognition language. The result of the OCR process was
  checked, but due to temporal restrictions, corrections were
  only made in a rough manner and remaining errors cannot be
  excluded.<span style="color: #000096;">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
  <span style="color: #000096;">&lt;p</span><span style="color: #000096;">&gt;</span>The spelling was checked and corrected where appropriate.<span style="color: #000096;">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
  <span style="color: #000096;">&lt;p</span><span style="color: #000096;">&gt;</span>The following phenomena were marked up: front matter (where
  available, e.g. title page, dedication, preface,
  introduction), part and chapter divisions, headings,
  paragraphs, inserted texts (e.g. letters or newspaper
  articles), direct speech or thought, verse lines, dramatic
  text, quotations (e.g. epigraphs), notes by the author, and
  gaps.<span style="color: #000096;">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
